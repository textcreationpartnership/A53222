                  <note>Apparently based in part on Arnoldus Montanus's "De Nieuwe en onbekende weereld: of beschryving van American en 't zuid-land," which was granted copyright privileges in July, 1670, and published in Amterdam in 1671. Sabin, who records an edition of Obilby as bearing date of 1670, says: "This English translation is, like Dapper's 'an impudent plagiarism' from Montanus, plates included." In the text many changes and additions were made by Ogilby, and his maps of Maryland, Jamaica and Barbados are not found in Montanus. The general map of America in Ogilby also differs materially from that in the Dutch work.</note>

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">The condition of the firſt World after the Floud.</note>When <hi>Noah</hi> went out of the Ark on Mount <hi>Ararat,</hi> and not long after, ſaw his Seed ſpread over <hi>Armenia</hi> and <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> the new Generation of People con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted in Shepherds and Husbandmen, that ſetled themſelves near Lakes and Rivers.

To curb growing-Wickedneſs, and the Pride of <hi>Libertines,</hi> who incroach'd upon their weaker Neighbors, Laws were invented, by which Bridle, the unbroke or wild World grew tamer: And firſt, the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> were brought to endure the Bit, and anſwer the Reins of Government; then <hi>Egypt,</hi> next <hi>Greece,</hi> and after that the <hi>Romans,</hi> who ſpreading their Power by Arms and Martial Diſcipline, firſt civiliz'd the <hi>Gauls, Spain, Brittain,</hi> and laſtly <hi>Germany.</hi>

                  <p>But becauſe a Countrey or Paſtoral Life, knowing no Commerce, but mean Hovels, and to dwell in Huts, priding in poor and no Habits, deſpiſing all greatneſs, unlimited by Laws, and all things elſe, (which the People obſerv'd preſently after the Flood) is now found among the <hi>Americans,</hi> who will take them for ought elſe, but new Comers to that Land, as themſelves acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge?

                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:56274:14"/>alſo ſhould here and there have a Tract of Land uninhabited? Theſe might by reaſon of their Barrenneſs, be uſeleſs, as many ſuch places are found in the midſt of the moſt Populous and fertile Countreys.

Moreover, This truth is not without ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Teſtimonies; when any one looks on the Iſlands with which <hi>America</hi> lies incompaſs'd, he may ſuppoſe they did not willingly go from the Main Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent to the Iſles, but were driven thither by Wars among themſelves, or as moſt times it happens, becauſe of the vaſt increaſe of the Natives, the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey muſt diſcharge its burden.</p>
               <p>Hereto is added, the ſeveral Languages us'd in <hi>America,</hi> as in <hi>Europe</hi> or any other part of the known World; whereby we may eaſily gueſs, that <hi>America</hi> was Peopled preſently after the Confuſion of Tongues at <hi>Babel.</hi> Furthermore, If the <hi>Americans</hi> live a Rude Life, go meanly Habited, be without ſtately Houſes; ſuch Cuſtoms are even among us obſerv'd by ſeveral People; as the <hi>Tartars, Numidians,</hi> and others, which made their Antiquity be call'd in queſtion.

                  <p>The Tranſporting of tame and profitable Cattel might eaſily be allow'd of, but who would load their Ships with Lions, Tygers, Bears, Wolves, Foxes, and other Serpents and Voracious Beaſts? it is certain that ſome may be tam'd before they were Ship'd.</p>

                  <p>They are ſo much inclin'd to Gaming, that they venture their Liberty at it.

                        <hi>Tartarian</hi> Horſes.</note> but the Wealth of this Countrey is reckon'd up in the numerous Breeds of Horſes, and ſeveral Studs of Mares. Some of the Nobleſs keep a thouſand Horſe; none, though never ſo poor, but keep two or three; and Beggars there mounted crave Alms and Charity of the People. When they remove their Habitations, their Horſes carry their Proviſions and Tents: If Proviſions grow ſhort, they eat Mares Milk, high guſted with Garlick, which ſatisfies Hunger and Thirſt; and the red Liquor which they tap warm from their Veins, ſerves them to help Digeſtion, and heighten their Humor, inſtead of the Blood of the Grape, our ſweet Wine. The ſwifteſt Rivers, though raging and precipitated with Land-floods, they dare adventure ſwimming their Horſes over, hanging naked by their Manes, and guiding them by a ſlipp'd Rein whither they pleaſe: To their Tails they tie their Saddles, and other Neceſſaries, bound up in Ruſhes. When a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of Quality prepares to croſs any River, they tie two Horſes Tail to Tail, and athwart both their Backs faſten a Mat pleited of Ruſhes, to ſit on. When they are ſtopp'd at any broad River, or ſtanding Lake, they kill and flea their worſt Horſes; then turning the Skins inſide out, and well Liquoring, they ſtretch them open with the Ribs, which ſtand like the Bayles of a Tilted Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and thus furniſh'd, ſerves them for a Boat to carry eight Perſons. When they take the Field, going to War, not any but muſters three Horſes; which makes their Armies, when drawn out in Campain, ſhew much bigger than indeed they are: And though many of them are kill'd in the Wars, or ſlain for Food, yet the <hi>European Tartars</hi> pay yearly forty thouſand Horſes to the <hi>Ruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians</hi> from whence <hi>Grotius</hi> thus argues, <q>If <hi>America</hi> joyns to <hi>Tartary,</hi> then the Horſes which run wild at Graſs might eaſily have found <hi>America</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, ſeeking to improve their Paſture, and have gone from one Countrey into the other, as it appears, that ſince the <hi>Spaniards</hi> tranſported Horſes to <hi>America,</hi> they are diſpers'd over the higheſt Mountains, out of one Province into the other: Or if the <hi>Straights of Anian</hi> run between both, the <hi>Tartars</hi> never were Navigators; and ſuppoſe they had been, they would not have croſs'd without Horſes, without which they knew not how to ſubſiſt.</q> To which we only ſay thus, That although <hi>Tartary</hi> now, and in former times, abounded in Horſe, yet muſt we grant, that it hath been always ſo? or that the ancient <hi>Scythians,</hi> who we avouch firſt planted <hi>America,</hi> had ſuch frequent uſe of them as the <hi>Tartars</hi> now. This may be controverted, for that theſe <hi>Scythians</hi> planting there in the Non-age of Time, preſently after the Flood, the uſe of Horſes was unknown, which the Ancient Poets teſtifie by their Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of <hi>Centaurs,</hi> who when firſt ſeen, the Horſe and Rider were taken for one Creature.

This Fiſh is the Natives Fiſher; for having a Line or hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom Cord faſtned about him, ſo ſoon as a Turtel, or any other of his Prey, comes above Water, they give him Line; whereupon the <hi>Guaican,</hi> like an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:56274:34"/>out of a Bowe, ſhoots towards the other Fiſh, and then gathering the Mouth of the Bag on his Head like a Purſe-net holds them ſo faſt, that he lets not looſe till hal'd up out of the Water.</p>
               <p>Here the <hi>Spaniards</hi> having Din'd on delicate Fiſh, went on ſtill Weſtward, and came to an uninhabited Iſle, but well ſtor'd with Geeſe, Pelicans, and ugly Dogs that could not bark. Here they came amongſt ſo many Shoals, that the Keels of their Ships raked upon the Ground almoſt forty Leagues together, the Water thick and white like Milk. Laſtly, they came again into deep Water, and Landed at the Foot of a high Mountain, on the Iſland <hi>Cuba;</hi> where they found two Springs of very ſweet Water. A Muſqueteer going into the Woods whilſt the reſt fill'd their Veſſels with Water and cut Wood, he ſpied a tall Man in a Coat like a white Fryer's Frock; behind whom came two more, and ſoon after thirty more follow'd, all alike Habited: the Muſqueteer running away, they beckned him to ſtay, but he march'd off; arid informing <hi>Columbus</hi> of his Adventure, he ſent a Party well Arm'd to ſee farther into the Countrey; but they neither ſaw nor heard any Men, onely found on the other ſide of the Wood a great Plain, but ſo overgrown with deep Graſs, that it was impoſſible to get through: The next day he ſent out twenty five more, which found no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe than the Prints of the Steps of great Beaſts and Lyons, and alſo abundance of large Grapes, which hung on the Branches of Vines, claſping about the Bodies of the great Trees.</p>
               <p>Hence <hi>Columbus</hi> again putting to Sea, and Sailing Weſterly, found a Shore overflow'd with Water, and abounding with Pearl-Muſsles, and after that the whole Countrey full of Mountains, whoſe tops ſmoaked. By this time the Fleet was much damnified by the Shole-water; where, as we mention'd before, they often ſtruck, and their Keels rak'd upon the Ground; ſo that having ſprung ſeveral Leaks, and their Proviſions growing mouldy with the Damp, they were forc'd to return; and Tacking about they ran againſt Turtles, which lay as thick in the Sea as if they had been ſow'n.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Columbus</hi> now on his return home, and Landing once more on <hi>Cuba,</hi> found an antient Man ſtark naked, who ſpeaking to him (<hi>Didacus</hi> interpreted, the Language in ſome part agreeing with that of <hi>Hiſpaniola</hi>) to this effect:</p>

The Ground is oftentimes terribly ſhaken by Earthquakes, and between ſeveral ſulphurous Places, both Flames and Smoak aſcend up to the Sky. Near the City <hi>Angra</hi> is a Fountain which turns Wood into Stone.

In <hi>Angra</hi> the chief Commander of all the <hi>Flemiſh</hi> Iſles hath his Reſidence. The City, ſurround<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by ſteep Rocks, lies towards the Sea like a Creſcent, or Half-Moon; for at both ends thereof the Mountains extend with deep Points into the Ocean.

On the laſt of <hi>July</hi> he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd three high Mountains; and approaching near the Shore, he ſmelt as in a Poſie, all the ſweet breathings of fragrant Flowers commix'd, and at laſt ſaw a convenient Haven; where going aſhore he found cultivated Grounds, and ſteps of Beaſts, but not a Man appear'd: the next day they ſpy'd a Boat with twenty young Men come rowing from the Shore into the Ocean. The Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral hal'd them in vain to come aboard, for they made the greater haſt aſhore,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:56274:38"/>ſtill looking about continually with great admiration on the Ships: whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he commanded them to beat their Drums, and ſound their Trumpets, that they might by that means entice them aboard; but they rather taking it as a ſign of War, made themſelves ready for reſiſtance: mean while the <hi>Spaniards</hi> overtook the <hi>Indian</hi> Boat, into which they threw a Hat, and other trifles; the Iſlanders amaz'd thereat, made ſigns to them to row aſhore; but ſoon after they fled.</p>

Thus all things even out-went whatever he could deſire, hope for, or imagine: And <hi>Alvaredo,</hi> one of his Commanders, being ſent Eaſtwardly, brought great Treaſures back with him, which the conquer'd Kings were forc'd to raiſe.</p>

                  <p>During the time that the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Officers had theſe Civil Broyls one againſt another, <hi>Lodowick Pontaeus,</hi> a Man well experienc'd in the Law, came from <hi>Spain</hi> to <hi>America,</hi> there in the Emperors Name to ſettle all things in good order; ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving alſo particular Inſtructions, to ſhew great kindneſs to <hi>Cortez,</hi> and to make him a Knight of the Order of <hi>St. James,</hi> that by that means the Emperor might be the more eſteem'd for his Noble Subjects and Servants, amongſt the <hi>Mexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans,</hi> who are themſelves of a proud and ambitious ſpirit, and chiefly the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, which doth manifeſtly appear by their Apparel, more gorgeous than the meaner ſort of <hi>Americans;</hi> and though the Slaves go ſtark naked (having onely a Cloth tied about their Privities) and with a Bowe and Arrows walk before their Lords,<note place="margin">

Here he ſpent ſome Weeks, effecting little; but now all things growing ſcarce, though he was very earneſt with the Natives for Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, yet he could get little; which kind of Life the Soldiers diſliking, and growing weary of, went away in the Night to <hi>Nicaragua.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Is forſaken of all.</note> 
                     <hi>Gottierez</hi> thus left alone, got into a Boat, with intent to follow them; and being juſt put off from the Shore, was met by Captain <hi>Barjanto,</hi> who brought new Forces and freſh Proviſions with him: This wrought upon him to ſtay there. Not long after <hi>Alphonſo de Piſa</hi> went with twenty ſeven Men from <hi>Nombre de Dios</hi> to the ſame River <hi>Suere;</hi> but it being then very rough at the Entrance, he was neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitated to paſs on to a ſmall uninhabited Iſle, where whilſt he lay at an Anchor, the Weather began to grow worſe and worſe; the Guſts of Wind,<note place="margin">Great Tempeſt.</note> mix'd with Showres of Rain, Thunder, and Lightning, ſeem'd to threaten a general De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction; for in the Ship two <hi>Spaniards</hi> and one <hi>Moor</hi> were kill'd by the Lightning: In ſeventy two Days, the Sun did not ſhine four Hours: At laſt weighing Anchor, he ſail'd over to the Main Land, where he ſaw nothing but vaſt Mountains and Wilderneſſes.

                     </note> About half way they met with the Lords of <hi>Suere</hi> and <hi>Chiuppa,</hi> going to attend <hi>Gottierez,</hi> to whom being admitted, and ſitting with him at Table, he gave them, as a Dainty, roſted Chickens and freſh Pork; but they gave it to their Servants,<note place="margin">Strange manner of eating.</note> not delighting in the taſte of ſuch Victuals. <hi>Gottierez,</hi> by means of an Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, told them concerning the <hi>Chriſtian-Religion,</hi> at which they bow'd their Heads, without making any Anſwer: But how little mind they had to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace it, quickly appear'd; for not long after, they ſet their Villages on fire, and all the Proviſions which they could not carry with them, they ſpoil'd, and ſo retiring, hid themſelves upon inacceſſible Mountains. Another Incentive leading them to this Fight, was, becauſe the Governor <hi>Camachiren,</hi> and his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puty (notwithſtanding he had given <hi>Gottierez</hi> as much Gold, when he came firſt into the Countrey, as amounted to ſeven thouſand Duckets, as we menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd before) yet was put in Priſon by his Order, contrary to all Promiſes: Nay, <hi>Gottierez</hi> threatned to burn him (not regarding, that he had beſides re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd of him ſeveral Pieces of Gold, reſembling all manner of Beaſts, as Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, and others; and alſo Fiſhes and Fowls curiouſly wrought, which were valu'd at two Tun of Gold; yet this Preſent ſeemed too little for him, whereupon bringing the Priſoner to a Cheſt,<note place="margin">Unſatisfied Covetouſneſs of <hi>Gottierez.</hi>
                     </note> he ſwore that he would roſt him by degrees, if in four days time he did not furniſh him with four times as much more Gold as that Cheſt would hold: Whereupon <hi>Chamachiren</hi>'s Servants went away to get the requir'd Gold; but he, through careleſneſs of the Watch, made his eſcape in the Night, ſo that <hi>Gottierez</hi> loſt his Booty.

<pb n="94" facs="tcp:56274:62"/>diſowning that they had any Gold; and among the reſt, one ſpeaking boldly to the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Officer ſaid, <hi>That he ſtood amaz'd at his treacherous dealings, why did he keep him Chain'd againſt Law and Promſe, and often threaten'd him with death, but yet would not kill him, for he, ſaid he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>Gottierez</hi>'s Conſcience troubling him, he would willingly have releas'd the <hi>Indian,</hi> and the rather, becauſe he promis'd to procure a great ranſome of Gold; but the inferior Commanders would not conſent to it. After this they march'd ſix days through great Wilderneſſes, and over high Mountains, find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no Footſteps of any People. Laſtly, They came down a very dangerous and ſteep Mountain, where had not the Shrubs and jutting Stones ſerv'd them to hold by, they had all broken their Necks.</p>

                  <p>Travelling forward, <hi>Gottierez</hi> ask'd an <hi>Indian</hi> which was the neareſt way to a Village, but he pretending not to know any near hand, had his Head imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately cut off.

From thence he ſteer'd North-North-Weſt, through abundance of floating Pieces of Timber, which often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times gave him great ſtops. The fourth of <hi>July</hi> he made <hi>Friezland,</hi> where he met with a great Storm of Hail, mix'd with Snow: Before the Shore lay a great Ridge of Ice, which hindred for a while their Landing: Here he ſaw ſeveral Wild People, but could not come to ſpeak with them; for upon the leaſt approach they fled; yet when they ſaw any advantage, made reſiſtance: At laſt, three of them came unarm'd to the Shore, beckoning <hi>Forbiſher</hi> to come to them; which he had done, had not great numbers of the Natives appear'd too ſoon from an Ambuſcade in a Wood, and behind a Hill, who ſeeing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves diſcover'd, march'd up into the Countrey, three onely ſtaying on the Shore, of whom the middlemoſt feigning to be lame, at laſt fell down, whom his Companions took up, and carried a little way, but then forſook, by which the <hi>Engliſh</hi> obſerving their Deſign, ſhot that the Sand flew all about him; whereupon forgetting his Lameneſs, he ran as ſwift as a Deer up a Hill.</p>

Cloſe fitted to their Bodies, they wore the Skins of ſeveral Wild Beaſts, priding in the Tails which hung down betwixt their Legs. Their Tents are of conjoyn'd Whalebones, cover'd over with the like Skins, the Entrance always facing the South.

Curioſity made them deſirous to make a further ſearch into the Countrey; wherefore he rowed du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring a whole Tide up a River; and when their Boat ran aground at the time of Ebb, he walk'd ſeveral Leagues up into the Countrey, where he ſaw nothing but Deer, Buffles, and Oſtriches: and becauſe he ſaw no People, he judg'd the Coaſt to be uninhabited; but returning again, he found it other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe; for the Sea-men, though commanded to ſtay in the Boat, which lay in the middle of the River, went aſhore, where they were ſo fiercely ſet upon by thirty of the Natives, that three of them were kill'd, and another wounded in the Leg.

Le Maire</hi> going into the Countrey, and climbing up a high Mountain, ſaw nothing but Moraſs Wilds, and Vallies, lying under Water: The King and his Retinue here kept him company, during his ſtay there, when weary with walking, they ſate down together under Coco-Nut-Trees; the young King tying a String about his Leg, climb'd with exceeding dexterity up a high Tree, bringing ſeveral Coco-Nuts down with him, which he open'd very expeditiouſly.</p>

                  <p>But the two Kings meeting again, the next day Complemented one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with more antick and ridiculous Poſtures, ſitting ſide by ſide under the Roof, imploring their God, with their Hands folded, and their Heads bow'd to the ground: At this interview, four <hi>Holland</hi> Trumpeters and Drummers ſtood playing before the King, to the great admiration and amazement of the Iſlanders, which were near ten thouſand gather'd together upon the News of the ſtrangers to attend the two Kings. Soon after a great company of Ruſticks came running thither, which had a green Herb call'd <hi>Cava,</hi>

They wear their Hair long, which Brayded, hung on the left ſide of their Heads down to their Hips, ty'd at the end with two Knots; but the Nobility had two ſuch Locks: All of them went naked, their Privities onely cover'd. The ſmalleſt of the Men exceeded the biggeſt of the <hi>Hollanders</hi> in tallneſs.<note place="margin">Impudent Women.</note> The Women had long Breaſts hanging like Satchels down to their Bellies, and ſo unſhamefac'd, that they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted themſelves to any, in ſight of all Men; and ſtill at low Water, their buſineſs was to catch Fiſh, which they greedily eat raw.</p>

<pb n="116" facs="tcp:56274:76"/>yet two of the <hi>Negro</hi>'s were taken, that in each Noſtril wore a Ring.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Jaques L' Hermite</hi> had ten Ships under his Command, Mann'd with ſixteen hundred thirty ſeven Men, and two hundred ninety four Braſs and Iron Guns, with which he ſet Sail from <hi>Goree, Anno</hi> 1623. and coming before <hi>Cape Vincent,</hi> he diſcover'd eleven <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Pirates, whom fighting, he beat, and re-took the <hi>Holland</hi> Ships they had made Prize of.</p>
                  <p>At <hi>Roxents Head, L' Hermite</hi> gave chaſe to fifteen <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ships, and coming up with them, ſunk eleven, and took four laden with Sugar.

                  <p>In ſhort time after, Sailing by the Mouth of the <hi>Straights</hi> of <hi>La Maire,</hi> they met with very tempeſtuous Weather, and ſeventeen of their Men going aſhore, were devour'd by the <hi>Cannibals</hi> of <hi>Terra del Fuogo.</hi> Theſe People being all <hi>Whites,</hi> and of a large Stature, Paint themſelves Red, and go ſtark naked, except ſome of higheſt quality who tie a Deer Skin about their Necks; and the Women co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver their Nakedneſs with a piece of Leather: They live in Bowers made of the Branches of Trees, Stak'd three Foot deep, in a round, at bottom, and above like our Tents, Canopy'd, the top of which open, to carry out the Smoke like a Chimney; and have no other Houſhold-ſtuff than ſome Baskets, in which they lay their few Fiſhing Implements.

                     <hi>L' Hermite</hi> having a deſign upon theſe, took three <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Veſſels that were going thither, and at midnight, ſent Captain <hi>Adrian Tol, Peter Slobbe,</hi> and <hi>Mein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dert Egbertſzon,</hi> with twelve well Mann'd Boats, furniſh'd with Braſs Drakes, and Hand-Granado's, to Attaque the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Fleet that lay hard by; and whilſt ſome gave a falſe Alarm on the North of <hi>Callao,</hi> the Boats Rowing from Ship to Ship, in ſhort time fir'd forty of them; although the <hi>Spaniards</hi> from the Shore endeavor'd by their Shot to drive back the Enemy, neither the Fort or Admiral ſparing Powder nor Ball.</p>
                  <p>In this valiant Exploit the <hi>Hollanders</hi> had onely ſeven Men kill'd, and fifteen Wounded: About break of day, ſeven of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ships floated, burning to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the <hi>Dutch</hi> Fleet, which were as terrible as now Fire-ſhips, which forc'd them to Weigh Anchor to ſhun them.</p>
                  <p>After that, <hi>L' Hermite</hi> took two Ships laden with Wine, a third full of Wood, and a fourth with Wheat: One of theſe Prizes he fitted and prepar'd for a Fire-ſhip, and ſending her to Board the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Admiral, it ran aground with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſhot of him; whereupon being batter'd by the Admirals Guns, and thoſe from the Bulwarks, and at laſt taking Fire gave but a ſmall blow, becauſe moſt part of the Powder had taken Wet.</p>

                  <hi>America,</hi> lying Weſtward of the <hi>Azores,</hi> and the Worlds Meridian, is by ſome ſuppos'd to conſiſt of one vaſt Iſland, and ſeveral leſſer ones ſcatter'd about it: Nor can this Suppoſition be thought improbable, if, as many think, it be environ'd with Sea on the North ſide, as towards the Eaſt, South, and Weſt it is known to be; Eaſt, by the <hi>Atlantick</hi> Ocean; South, by the <hi>Magellanick</hi> Straight; and Weſt, by <hi>Mare del Zur.</hi> But becauſe the North-Weſt Paſſage, though attempted by many, as <hi>Nelſon, Davis, Forbiſher, Button, Smith, Hudſon,</hi> and others, hath not yet been fully diſcover'd by any, ſo that it is not certainly known whether <hi>America</hi> be joyn'd to <hi>Groenland</hi> and the <hi>Arctick</hi> Region, by a continu'd Tract of Land, or ſever'd by the Ocean, we ſhall follow the method of thoſe Geographers, who reputed ſufficiently authentick, have divided this <hi>New World</hi> into Iſlands, and two grand <hi>Peninſula's,</hi> joyn'd together by an <hi>Iſthmus,</hi> or Neck of Land, call'd <hi>The Straight of Darien,</hi> by ſome <hi>The Straight of Panama,</hi> lying almoſt under the <hi>Equinoctial Line,</hi> and extending in length from <hi>Nombre de Dios</hi> Southward, above a hundred <hi>Engliſh</hi> Miles, and from Eaſt to Weſt ſeventeen Miles over in the narroweſt place. Of theſe two grand <hi>Peninſula's</hi> the Northern is generally call'd <hi>America Mexicana,</hi> from <hi>Mexico,</hi> the chief City of the Province, properly call'd <hi>Mexicana;</hi> which without doubt was hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

Thoſe therefore of the <hi>Northern America</hi> (that as near as can be we may bring many into one) ſeem moſt fitly deſcrib'd in this following order: 1. <hi>Eſtotiland.</hi> 2. <hi>Terra Laboratoris,</hi> or <hi>Nova Britannia.</hi> 3. <hi>Canada,</hi> or <hi>Nova Francia.</hi> 4. <hi>Nova Scotia.</hi> 5. <hi>Norumbegua.</hi> 6. <hi>New England.</hi> 7. <hi>New Netherland,</hi> now call'd <hi>New York,</hi> as being in the poſſeſſion of the <hi>Engliſh.</hi> 8. <hi>Mary-Land.</hi> 9. <hi>Apalchen,</hi> now call'd <hi>Virginia.</hi> 10. <hi>Carolina.</hi> 11. <hi>Florida.</hi> 12. <hi>Jucatan.</hi> 13. <hi>Guatimala,</hi> containing <hi>Chiapa, Vera Paz, Honduras, Nicaragua, Coſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, Veragua, Guatimala,</hi> properly ſo call'd. 14.

                  <p>The Natives of <hi>Nova Francia</hi> anoint their bodies with Oil; in the Summer they go naked, and in the Winter mantle themſelves in Furs.

                  <p>At that ſeaſon when the Corn covers the ground, to any heighth, they eat Cockles, Dogs, dead Caryon, and the Skins wherewith they Clothe themſelves.

                  <p>Before and about the Mouth of this River, which is judg'd to be about eight or nine Miles broad, lie many ſmall Iſlands, or rather Hills, inviron'd with Water, the chiefeſt of which is by the <hi>French</hi> call'd <hi>La Haute Iſle,</hi> from the high and Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainous appearance of it to thoſe that ſee it from afar off at Sea.</p>

                  <note place="margin">The ſetling of Plantations.</note>This Countrey, whether firſt diſcover'd by the ſaid <hi>Verrazanus,</hi> or together with the reſt of largely-taken <hi>Virginia,</hi> by Sir <hi>Walter Raleigh,</hi> or, as ſome ſay, by Captain <hi>Goſnald,</hi> in the Year 1602. was ſo well known to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of King <hi>James</hi>'s Reign here, that the ſetling and carrying on of Plantations id this part of <hi>America,</hi> was vigorouſly promoted by many of the moſt eminent Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in <hi>England:</hi> whereupon it was about the Year 1606. being the fourth Year of the ſaid King, granted by Patent to ſeveral Lords, Knights, Gentlemen and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, under the denomination of <hi>The Plymouth Company,</hi> both in favour of thoſe generous Spirits, who ſtudied and endeavor'd the good of the Publick by foreign Plantations, and indulgence to thoſe, who not well ſatisfi'd with the Government of Church and State, and willingly tranſporting themſelves and Families thither, as to their <hi>Aſylum,</hi> could more conveniently be ſpar'd than the better affected part of the People: And although the Colonies at firſt ſent over ſucceeded not accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to expectation, yet in a ſhort time there Plantations were brought to very great perfection. Captain <hi>Weimouth,</hi> who had been employ'd there by the Lord <hi>Arundel</hi> of <hi>Warder,</hi> for the diſcovery of the North-Weſt Paſſage, falling ſhort of his Courſe, hapned into a River on the Coaſt of <hi>America,</hi> call'd <hi>Pemmaquid;</hi> from whence he brought five of the Natives for <hi>England,</hi> three of whoſe Names were <hi>Mannida<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Skettwarroes,</hi> and <hi>Taſquantum,</hi> and Landing at <hi>Plymouth,</hi> preſented them to Sir <hi>Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nando Gorges,</hi> whom he made uſe of as Inſtruments for the farther advancement of theſe Plantations: they were all of one Nation, but of ſeveral parts, and ſeveral Families; he kept them with him three years, and obſerving in them an inclination to vertuous Deſigns, and Spirits above the Vulgar, he gain'd information from
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:56274:86"/>them what great Rivers ran up into the Land, what Men of note were ſeated on them, what Power they were of, how Ally'd, what Enemies they had, and the like; and taking ſome light from thence, ſent away a Ship, furniſh'd with Men, and all kind of Neceſſaries convenient for the Service intended, under the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of Captain <hi>Henry Chaloung,</hi> a Gentleman of a good Family, and very capable for Undertakings of this nature; and giving him ſufficient Inſtructions what to do, ſent along with him two of the ſaid Natives for his better Conduct and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, ordering him by all means to keep the Northerly Gage as high as <hi>Cape Briton,</hi> till they had diſcover'd the Main, and then to beat it up to the Southward as the Coaſt tended, till they found by the Natives they were near the place to which they were aſſign'd. By that time they were about a hundred Leagues off the Iſland of <hi>Canara,</hi> the Captain fell ſick of a Feaver, and the Winds being Weſterly, his Company ſhap'd their Courſe for the <hi>Indies,</hi> and coming to <hi>St. John de Porto Rico,</hi> the Captain went aſhore for the recovery of his Health, whilſt the Company took in Water, and ſuch other Proviſions as they had preſent need of, and ſpent ſome time in Hunting, and other Recreations; after which ſteering their intended Courſe, they were met with by the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Fleet that came from the <hi>Havana,</hi> taken Priſoners and carried into <hi>Spain,</hi> the Ship and Goods being confiſcated, the Voyage overthrown, and the Natives loſt.</p>
               <p>Not long after the ſetting out of <hi>Chaloung, Thomas Haman</hi> was ſent by Sir <hi>John Popham,</hi> Lord Chief Juſtice of <hi>England,</hi> towards the River of <hi>Sagadehoc,</hi> to the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour of <hi>Chaloung,</hi> if need were; but not finding him, after he had ſcowr'd the Coaſt all about, he return'd back into <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Captain <hi>Prinne</hi> was likewiſe ſent from <hi>Briſtol,</hi> who arriving happily in thoſe Parts, brought back with him at his return the moſt exact Diſcovery of that Coaſt that ever had been gain'd till then.</p>
               <p>A while after, at the Charge of the ſaid Sir <hi>John Popham,</hi> a hundred Men were ſent to ſettle a Colony at <hi>Sagadehoc,</hi> under the Command of <hi>George Popham, Raleigh Gilbert,</hi> Maſter of the Ship, who ſeated themſelves in a <hi>Peninſula,</hi> at the Mouth of this River; which attempting to diſcover, they met with a Wood near to an Iſland, diſtant from the Line about forty five Degrees, and ſome odd Seconds, where they eaſily went on Shore. In the Year 1608. the Commander of the Colony deceaſing, and not long after him the Lord Chief Juſtice, who had been the chief that had furniſh'd them with freſh Supplies, they return'd for <hi>England</hi> in thoſe Ships that had been ſent them with Succours: At which unexpected return, the Patrons of the Deſign were ſo offended, that for a certain time they deſiſted from their Enterprizes. In the mean while the <hi>French</hi> making uſe of this occaſion, Planted Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies in divers places, when Sir <hi>Samuel Argal</hi> from <hi>Virginia</hi> diſturb'd their Deſigns, and brought away Priſoners all he could lay hold on.</p>
               <p>Suddenly after Captain <hi>Hobſon</hi> and divers others were ſet out with very great Preparations, and with them two of the Natives which had been detain'd for ſome time in <hi>England,</hi> whom they thought to have made uſe of, the better to draw the reſt of the Natives to their Commerce; but becauſe a little before twenty four of them had been treacherouſly dealt with by one <hi>Hunt,</hi> they contracted from thence ſo great an animoſity towards the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> that Captain <hi>Hobſon</hi> was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain'd to return without effecting any thing.</p>
               <p>In the Year 1614. Captain <hi>John Smith</hi> being ſent to Fiſh for Whales, and ſeek af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Mines of Gold and Silver, Landed upon the Iſland of <hi>Monahiggan,</hi> where he found ſome ſtore of Whales, but not ſuch as thoſe by whoſe Oyl they uſe to make ſo much profit.</p>
               <pb n="142" facs="tcp:56274:87"/>
               <p>About the ſame time (two of the Natives being recover'd, <hi>Erpenow</hi> of <hi>Capawick,</hi> that had eſcap'd from Captain <hi>Hobſon,</hi> and <hi>Aſſacumet</hi> of <hi>Pemmaquid,</hi> one of thoſe that had been taken Priſoners with <hi>Chaloung</hi>) Captain <hi>Harly,</hi> with Neceſſaries con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient for ſuch a Voyage, was diſpatch'd away by Sir <hi>Ferdinando Gorges,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Southampton</hi> favouring the Deſign, and furniſhing him with ſome Land-Soldiers under the Command of Captain <hi>Hobſon;</hi> who not diſcourag'd with his former ill Succeſs, reſolv'd upon a ſecond Adventure.</p>
               <p>In the Year 1615. Sir <hi>Richard Hakings</hi> undertook a Voyage into thoſe Parts by authority of the Council of the ſecond Colony, but by reaſon of the great Wars among the Natives, his Obſervations could not be ſuch as might give any farther light than what had been already receiv'd.</p>
               <p>Soon after which Captain <hi>Dormer</hi> coming for <hi>England</hi> from <hi>New-found-Land,</hi> and Landing at <hi>Plymouth,</hi> apply'd himſelf to the Governor, by whom he was diſpatch'd away, with Direction to meet Captain <hi>Rocroft,</hi> ſent away a little before; but <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croft</hi> being dead by that time <hi>Dormer</hi> could come after him to <hi>Virginia,</hi> where he heard he was, he returning to <hi>Capawick,</hi> was there ſet upon by <hi>Erpenow,</hi> the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mention'd Salvage, and other <hi>Indians</hi> that were Conſpirators with him; and within a ſhort while after at <hi>Virginia,</hi> whither he went to be cur'd of the Wounds he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd in that Aſſaſſination, he fell ſick and died.</p>
               <p>About the Year 1623. Captain <hi>Robert Gorges,</hi> newly come out of the <hi>Venetian</hi> War, was employ'd by the Council of <hi>New Englands</hi> Affairs as the Lieutenant-General, to regulate the Abuſes of divers Fiſher-men and other Interlopers, who without Licenſe frequented thoſe Coaſts: for which Service he had aſſign'd to him all that part of the main Land ſituate upon the North-Eaſt ſide of the Bay of the <hi>Meſſachaſets.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By theſe ſeveral Colonies ſent ſo thick one after another, both a full Diſcovery of the Countrey came to be made, and a large gap open'd to the free poſſeſſion thereof; yet in regard of the many diſappointments and misfortunes the ſeveral Companies ſent over met with, and counting the vaſt Charges their ſetting forth coſt the Undertakers, which would have been ſtill increas'd by the need of conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nu'd Supplies, in all probability <hi>New England</hi> would have been but thinly peopled to this day, had not a great Tide of People, poſſeſs'd with an averſion to the Church-Government of <hi>England,</hi> and fled into <hi>Holland</hi> for <hi>Liberty of Conſcience,</hi> ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerly taken hold of this opportunity to make themſelves Maſters of their own Opinions, and of a Place where they might erect a Government ſuitable there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto: and though at firſt there were ſome Exceptions taken, as if this Countrey was to be made a Receptacle of Sectaries, and ſuch as condemn'd the Eccleſiaſtical Government of the Nation, inſomuch that Sir <hi>Ferdinando Gorges,</hi> to whom they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd themſelves, deſiring him to mediate for them to the Council of <hi>New Englands</hi> Affairs, when they perceiv'd the Authority they had from the <hi>Virginia</hi> Company, could not warrant their abode there, had enough to do (notwithſtanding his Apology, <hi>That theſe things hapned contrary to his expectation</hi>) to wipe away the jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie which was entertain'd of him, it being Order'd, that no more ſhould be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd to paſs into <hi>New England,</hi> but ſuch as ſhould take the Oaths of Allegiance and Supremacy: yet at laſt there was little notice taken who went, perhaps upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, that the vaſt reſort of People thither would be of greater advantage to the Plantations, than their different Opinions, at ſo remote a diſtance, could be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial, ſo long as they acknowledg'd Obedience to the King and Civil Power: However, Sir <hi>Ferdinando,</hi> to clear himſelf the better, mov'd thoſe Lords that were the chief Actors in the Buſineſs, to reſign their Grand Patent to the King, and paſs
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:56274:87"/>particular Patents to themſelves of ſuch part of the Countrey along the Sea-Coaſt, as might be ſufficient for them: To this Motion there being a general Aſſent given by the Lords, and a Day appointed for the concluſion thereof, an Act was made for the Reſignation of the Patent, alloting to each Man their ſeveral Bounds. From the uttermoſt parts began the Limits of the Lord <hi>Mougrave,</hi> and ended at <hi>Hudſon</hi>'s <hi>River.</hi> To the Eaſtward of which River, for the ſpace of ſixty Miles in length, was plac'd the Duke of <hi>Richmond</hi>'s Aſſignment: Next to him was ſetled the Earl of <hi>Carlile:</hi> Next him the Lord <hi>Edward Gorges:</hi> Next the Marqueſs of <hi>Hamilton:</hi> Then Captain <hi>John Maſon:</hi> And laſtly his own, which extended to the great River <hi>Sagadehoc,</hi> being ſixty Miles, and ſo up into the Main Land a hundred and twenty Miles, which he was pleas'd to call by the Name of <hi>The Province of Main.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Landing of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in <hi>Plymouth</hi> Plantation was very much facilitated by the great Mortality that hapned amongſt the <hi>Indians</hi> about that time, amongſt the <hi>Pecods, Narraganſets, Nianticks, Tarantines, Wippanaps,</hi> and thoſe of <hi>Abargini, Agiſſawang,</hi> and <hi>Pockanekie,</hi> their <hi>Powwows,</hi> or Doctors, ſeeing with amazement their <hi>Wigwams,</hi> or Streets, lie full of dead Bodies, and in vain expecting help from <hi>Squantam</hi> their good, or <hi>Abbamoch</hi> their bad God. Not long before, that blazing Comet, ſo much talk'd of in <hi>Europe,</hi> apppear'd after Sun-ſetting in their Horizon South-Weſt for the ſpace of thirty Sleeps, (for ſo they reckon their Days). They Landed at firſt with little or no reſiſtance, a handful of Men onely being ſent before to keep poſſeſſion for their Companions, who arriv'd eight days after; when the Natives appearing with their Bowes and Arrows, let flie their long Shafts amongſt them; whereupon one Captain <hi>Miles Standiſh</hi> with his Fowling-piece ſhot the ſtouteſt <hi>Sachem</hi> amongſt the <hi>Indians,</hi> as he was reaching an Arrow from his Quiver; which the reſt ſeeing, fled into the Woods and Thickets.</p>
               <p>The ſame Year the <hi>Merchant-Advenurers</hi> in <hi>England</hi> ſent forth ſtore of Servants to provide againſt the Wants of that place; amongſt whom came over a mix'd Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, who ſetled themſelves in the Boſom of the Cape now call'd <hi>Glouceſter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>About the Year 1651. there fled to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> at <hi>Water-town</hi> the <hi>Indians</hi> that dwelt thereabouts, for protection againſt the <hi>Tarratines,</hi> a ſort of cruel and ſalvage Canni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bals, by whom near the Town of <hi>Sauguſt,</hi> in the very dead time of the Night, one Lieutenant <hi>Walker</hi> being on a ſudden alarm'd, was ſhot through his Coat and Buff Jacket with two Indian Arrows. That Night the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſtood upon their Guard, and the next Morning ſent word to other parts; who gather'd together, and taking counſel how to quit themſelves of theſe <hi>Indians,</hi> agreed to diſcharge their great Guns; whoſe redoubled noiſe, ratling in the Rocks, ſtruck terror into the <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> and caus'd them to betake themſelves to flight. The Autumn following, others of the <hi>Indians,</hi> who till then had held a good correſpondence with the Planters, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to quarrel about the Bounds of their Land; but a great Mortality, by the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of the Small-Pox, breaking out amongſt them, put an end to that Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie: There died amongſt the reſt one of the chief of the <hi>Sagamores</hi> of the <hi>Matta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chuſets,</hi> call'd <hi>Sagamore John,</hi> who before his Death had been inſtructed in the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian</hi> Faith, and took care that his two Sons ſhould be nurtur'd therein.</p>
               <p>In the Year 1635. there arrived ſeveral Ships with great plenty of Proviſions, and many Perſons of good Quality, and amongſt the reſt Sir <hi>Henry Vane.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſame Year the People of <hi>Cambridge,</hi> otherwiſe call'd <hi>New-town,</hi> hearing of a fertile place upon the River <hi>Canectico,</hi> remov'd thither, and erected anew Corporati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by the Name of <hi>Banectico,</hi> being encourag'd thereunto by the Lord <hi>Say</hi> and the Lord <hi>Brooks,</hi> and planting a Forreſt at the mouth of the River, call'd it <hi>Saybrook Forreſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>About the Year 1638. the <hi>Pequods,</hi> a ſtout and Warlike Nation, lying to the
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:56274:88"/>South-Weſt of the <hi>Mattachuſets,</hi> were diſcover'd upon their March within ſome few Miles of <hi>Hartford:</hi> Their coming very much terrifi'd all that inhabited therea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouts; but they took onely three Women and return'd; one of whom making a violent reſiſtance, had her Brains beaten out; the other two they carried away with them, without abuſing their Perſons, as it was ſuppos'd they would, for they eſteem'd their own <hi>Shaws,</hi> being black, beyond our Women. Their chief Deſign was to learn to make Gunpowder; which ſeeing they could not effect, they look'd upon their Prize as nothing ſo precious as they imagin'd.</p>
               <p>A little after another <hi>Indian</hi> War threatning the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> they reſolv'd together to ſend an Ambaſſador to <hi>Cannonicus,</hi> chief <hi>Sachem</hi> of the <hi>Naraganſits,</hi> endeavoring to prevent him from confederating with the <hi>Pequods,</hi> who (as they had Intelligence) were about ſending to him to joyn with them: <hi>Cannonicus</hi> being grown old, had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd the Government to his Nephew <hi>Mantinemo,</hi> a ſtern Man, and of a cruel Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. The Ambaſſadors arriving at his Court, which was about eighty Miles from <hi>Boſton,</hi> the <hi>Indian</hi> Prince aſſembled his chief Councellors, and having Entertain'd the Ambaſſadors Magnificently, and Feaſted them Royally, gave them Audience in his State-houſe; where the <hi>Sachem,</hi> to manifeſt his greater State, lay along upon the Ground, with all his Nobility ſitting about him, with their Legs doubled up, and their Knees touching their Chin: The <hi>Engliſh</hi> Interpreter having made his Speech in the Name of the reſt, both <hi>Cannonicus</hi> and the young King gave diſcreet Anſwers, ſignifying their Reſolutions to keep a fair Correſpondence with the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh,</hi> and yet not to fall out with the <hi>Pequods:</hi> Who a little after making alſo their Addreſſes to the ſame King, he diſſwaded them by many Reaſons from making War with the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and to deliver into their hands thoſe Perſons that had murther'd any of them. The <hi>Pequods</hi> nevertheleſs, though they ſeem'd inclinable to his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, yet they acted as Enemies; for when the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſent a Company of Soldiers into their Countrey to treat with them about delivering up the Murtherers, they made ſhew of willingneſs, but ſpying their advantage, betook themſelves to their Heels; and whomſoever they took ſtragling by ſurpriſe, they revil'd and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted over in a moſt cruel manner, vilifying the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Religion, and uttering all the Blaſphemies they could invent. Whereupon they rais'd freſh Souldiers for the War, to the number of four ſcore, out of the ſeveral Towns in the <hi>Mattachuſets,</hi> and with ſome <hi>Indian</hi> Guides came to their Fort, within which they had pitch'd their <hi>Wigwams,</hi> the Entrance being on two ſides, with intricate Meanders to enter; at which were plac'd <hi>Indian</hi> Bowe-men, who ſhot the foremoſt of the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> yet they had little to boaſt of in the end, for the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ruſhing in through the winding Ways, and placing themſelves round the <hi>Wigwams,</hi> made a very proſperous Shot, by directing the Muzzles of their Muſquets againſt the <hi>Indians</hi> which lay ſleeping on the Ground: In the midſt of which rouzing terror and confuſion they were defeated with little ado, moſt of them being either wounded, kill'd, or taken. The <hi>Engliſh</hi> thus animated with the firſt Victory, ſend their Priſoners to the Pinna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and proſecute the War in Hand, marching againſt the next Body of the <hi>Indians,</hi> which lay Encamp'd on a Hill about two Miles diſtant, where they gave them a ſecond Overthrow, ſlaying many more than in the firſt Engagement; the reſt flying to a very thick inacceſſible Swamp or Bog, were there beſieg'd by the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> and skulking up and down, as they ſaw their opportunity they would Shoot at them with their Arrows, and then ſuddenly fall flat along in the Water; at laſt the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> finding out a Paſſage into the Swamp, utterly defeated them, and put an end to the War with the loſs of few Mens Lives, and not many wounded.</p>
               <p>In the Year 1640. there came over a freſh Supply of People into <hi>New England,</hi> and
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:56274:88"/>finding no place to ſettle in within any of the former erected Colonies, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair'd to a place call'd <hi>Long Iſland,</hi> ſever'd from the Continent of <hi>New-Haven,</hi> about ſixty Miles off the Sea.</p>
               <p>The Year following the four Colonies, namely the <hi>Maſſachuſets, Plymouth, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nectico,</hi> and <hi>New-Haven,</hi> taking into conſideration the many Nations that were on all ſides of them, as the <hi>French, Dutch, Jews,</hi> and native <hi>Indians;</hi> as alſo how the three firſt went to lay claim to Lands they never had any right to, and the laſt to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually quarrelling and contending, where they ſaw any hopes of prevailing, by Commiſſioners choſen from the reſpective Colonies, concluded a firm Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration to aſſiſt each other in all juſt and lawful Wars; upon which there came in certain <hi>Indian Sachems,</hi> as <hi>Pomham, Miantonemo, Soccanocoh,</hi> and <hi>Uncas,</hi> who not onely ſubmitted to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Government, but alſo, if occaſion were, in matters of Controverſie ſubmitted to their Arbitration: But the Conteſt between <hi>Mianto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemo</hi> and <hi>Uncas</hi> was too hot to be appeas'd, (though the <hi>English</hi> were not wanting to interpoſe) unleſs by the Blood of one of them, as will appear by the Conſequence: <hi>Uncas</hi> was a Prince of <hi>For,</hi> whoſe Life <hi>Miantonemo,</hi> though a much more potent Prince, ſought to take away by treachery, hiring a young Man of the <hi>Pequod</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to murther him, as the following Story renders ſuſpected; for one dark Evening this <hi>Sachem</hi> paſſing from one <hi>Wigwam</hi> to another, was Shot through the Arm with an Arrow; but recovering the Palace, had the Arrow pull'd out, and his Arm cur'd: the young Man that was ſuſpected being examin'd, how he came by that great ſtore of <hi>Wampompeage</hi> which was found about him, and being able to give no good account, it increas'd the ſuſpicion, and induc'd <hi>Uncas</hi> to complain to the <hi>English</hi> at a General Court held at <hi>Boſton:</hi> Whereupon the young Man was Examin'd in the preſence of <hi>Miantonemo,</hi> who came thither with his Attendants; but the young Man tutor'd, as ſuppos'd, by <hi>Miantonemo,</hi> pretended that <hi>Uncas</hi> had enjoyn'd him to feign that he was hir'd by <hi>Miantonemo</hi> to kill him: To which Tale of his little belief being given, it was concluded upon farther Examination of him in private that he had done the Fact: nevertheleſs they let him depart with <hi>Mianto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemo,</hi> adviſing him to ſend him home to <hi>Uncas;</hi> but he in ſtead of returning him cut off his Head, and forthwith gather'd an Army of a thouſand Men to fight with <hi>Uncas;</hi> who met him with half the Men: the Battel being joyn'd, the <hi>Narraganſets,</hi> though the far greater multitude, were beaten by the <hi>Wawhiggins,</hi> through the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of <hi>Uncas</hi> their Prince; who perfected his Victory by poſſeſſing himſelf of the Perſon of <hi>Miantonemo,</hi> whom, having put his Life-guard to flight, he carried away with him in triumph to the Town of <hi>Hartford,</hi> deſiring to have the advice of the United Colonies what to do with his Priſoner: Whereupon the Commiſſioners having had ſufficient proof of <hi>Miantonemo</hi>'s treachery towards this Prince, advis'd <hi>Uncas</hi> to put him to death, but not to exerciſe that barbarous kind of cruelty which is uſual amongſt them in theſe Caſes. The <hi>Sachem,</hi> upon this advice, not long after pretended to remove him to a ſafer place, but by the Way caus'd him to be Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: His Subjects and Kindred were troubled at his Death, but the little Princes his Neighbors, over whom he had tyranniz'd, rather rejoyc'd.</p>
               <p>In the Year 1645. the Sons of old <hi>Canonnicus,</hi> their Father being dead, began to fall into hot Contentions with their Neighbors, and being forbidden by the United Colonies, they did not ſtick to threaten Wars to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> alſo. Whereupon the Commiſſioners rais'd an Army of Horſe and Foot, and made Major General <hi>Edward Gibbons</hi> Commander in Chief over them. But the <hi>Indians</hi> hearing of this Preparation, ſent ſome of their chief Nobility to the Commiſſioners of the United Colonies, who were aſſembled at <hi>Boſton,</hi> to Treat about Peace; to which the
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:56274:89"/>Commiſſioners agreed, upon condition they ſhould pay a part of the Charges of the War; and that they ſhould ſend four of their Sons for Hoſtages till the Sum was paid; and the Hoſtages being ſent back before the <hi>Wapom</hi> was all paid, the two Princes, <hi>Peſicus</hi> and <hi>Mexanimo,</hi> upon the ſending a Company of Armed Men to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand it, ſent the remainder of the Money.</p>
               <p>In the Year 1647. divers Perſons of Quality ventur'd their Eſtates upon an Iron Mill, which they began at <hi>Braintree,</hi> but it profited the Owners little, rather waſting their Stock, the price of Labor in matters of that nature, being double or treble to what it is in <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>

<pb n="147" facs="tcp:56274:89"/>wide in the Head, their fleſh is as good as Beef, their Hides good for Clothing; if theſe were kept tame, and accuſtom'd to the Yoke, they would be a great Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity: Firſt, becauſe they are ſo fruitful, bringing forth three at a time, being likewiſe very uberous: Secondly, becauſe they will live in Winter without any Fodder.

               <p>The <hi>Baſſe</hi> is one of the beſt Fiſhes in the Countrey,<note place="margin">The Baſſe.</note> and though Men are ſoon weary'd with other Fiſh, yet are they never with <hi>Baſſe;</hi> it is a delicate, fine, fat, faſt Fiſh, having a Bone in his Head which contains a Sawcerful of Marrow, ſweet and good, pleaſant to the Palate, and wholſom to the Stomack: When there be great ſtore of them, we only eat the Heads, and Salt up the Bodies for Winter, which exceeds Ling or Haberdine: Of theſe Fiſhes ſome are three, and ſome four Foot long, ſome bigger, ſome leſſer; at ſome Tides a Man may catch a dozen or twenty of theſe in three hours; the way to catch them is with Hook and Line: The Fiſherman taking a great Cod-line, to which he faſteneth a piece of Lobſter, throws it into the Sea, the Fiſh biting at it, he pulls her to him, and knocks her on the head with a Stick.</p>

When the Tide ebbs and flows, a Man running over theſe <hi>Clamm</hi> banks will preſently be made all wet, by their ſpouting of Water out of thoſe ſmall holes: Theſe Fiſhes are in great plenty in moſt places of the Countrey, which is a great Commodity for the feeding of Swine, both in Winter and Summer; for being
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:56274:90"/>once us'd to thoſe places, they will repair to them as duly every Ebb, as if they were driven to them by Keepers: In ſome places of the Countrey there be <hi>Clamms</hi> as big as a Peny white Loaf, which are great Dainties amongſt the Natives, and would be in great eſteem amongſt the <hi>English,</hi> were it not for better Fiſh.</p>
               <p>Other Commodities which this Countrey is ſaid to yield, are, in down-right Proſe, Furrs, Flax, Linnen, Iron, Pitch, Maſts, Cables, and ſome quantity of Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; ſo that if what many Authors have conſented to aſſert concerning <hi>New Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> be not a meer Fiction, what e're hath been affirm'd of the unfruitfulneſs of the Country will demonſtrably be found invalid.</p>
               <p>There are alſo to be found here ſome hurtful Creatures,<note place="margin">Noxious Creatures.</note> of which, that which is moſt injurious to the Perſon and Life of a Man is the <hi>Rattle-Snake,</hi> which is generally a yard and a half long, as thick in the middle as the ſmall of a Mans Leg; ſhe hath a yellow Belly, her Back being ſpotted with black, ruſſet, yellow, and green colours, plac'd like Scales; at her Tail is a Rattle, with which ſhe makes a noiſe when ſhe is moleſted, or when ſhe ſeeth any approach near her; her Neck ſeems to be no thicker than a Mans Thumb, yet ſhe can ſwallow a Squirril, having a great wide Mouth, with Teeth as ſharp as Needles, wherewith ſhe biteth ſuch as tread upon her, her Poyſon lyeth in her Teeth, for ſhe hath no Sting. When any Man is bitten by any of theſe Creatures, the Poyſon ſpreads ſo ſuddenly through the Veins, and ſo runs to the Heart, that in one hour it cauſeth Death, unleſs he hath the Antidote to expel the Poyſon, which is a Root call'd <hi>Snake-weed,</hi> which muſt be champ'd, the Spittle ſwallow'd, and the Root apply'd to the Sore; this is preſent Cure againſt that which would be preſent death with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it: This Weed is rank Poyſon, if it be taken by any man that is not bitten; whoſoever is bitten by theſe Snakes, his fleſh becomes as ſpotted as a Leopard, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til he be perfectly cur'd. It is reported, that if the Party live that is bitten, the Snake will die, and if the Party die, the Snake will live. This is a moſt Poyſonous and dangerous Animal, yet nothing ſo bad as the report goes of it in <hi>England;</hi> for whereas it is ſaid to kill a Man with its breath, and that it can flie, there is no ſuch matter, for it is naturally the moſt ſleepy and unnimble Creature that lives, never offering to leap or bite any Man, if it be not trodden on firſt; and it is their deſire in hot weather to lie in Paths, where the Sun may ſhine on them, where they will ſleep ſo ſoundly, that I have known four Men ſtride over one of them, and never awake it; five or ſix Men have been bitten by them, which by uſing of <hi>Snake-weed</hi> were all cur'd, never any yet loſing his life by them. Cows have been bitten, but being cut in divers places, and this Weed thruſt into their fleſh, were cur'd; A ſmall Switch will eaſily kill one of theſe Snakes. In many places of the Country there be none of them, as at <hi>Plymouth, New-town, Igowamme, Nahant, &amp;c.</hi> In ſome places they will live on one ſide of the River, and ſwimming but over the Water, as ſoon as they are come into the Woods, they turn up their yellow Bellies and die. Up into the Countrey, Weſtward from the Plantations, is a high Hill, which is call'd <hi>Rattle-Snake-Hill,</hi> where there are great ſtore of theſe Poyſonous Creatures.</p>
               <p>There are likewiſe troubleſome Flies.</p>
               <p>Firſt there is a wild Bee or Waſp, which commonly guards the Grape, building by Cobweb habitation amongſt the Leaves: Secondly a great green Flie, not much unlike our Horſe-Flies in <hi>England;</hi> they will nipp ſo ſore, that they will fetch Blood either of Man or Beaſt, and are moſt troubleſome where moſt Cattel are, which brings them from out of the Woods to the Houſes; this Flie continues but for the Moneth of <hi>June.</hi> The third is <hi>Gurnipper,</hi> which is a ſmall black Flie, no bigger than a Flea; her biting cauſeth an itching upon the Hands or Face, which
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:56274:91"/>provoketh ſcratching, which is troubleſome to ſome; this Flie is buſie but in cloſe Mornings or Evenings, and continues not above three Weeks; the leaſt Wind or heat expels them. The fourth is a <hi>Musketor,</hi> which is not unlike to our Gnats in <hi>England;</hi> in places where there is no thick Woods or <hi>Swamps,</hi> there are none or ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry few.

He that is a noted Gameſter hath a Hole in his Ear, wherein he carries his <hi>Puims</hi> in defiance of his Antagoniſts. <hi>Hubbub</hi> is five ſmall Bones in a ſmall ſmooth Tray; the Bones be like a Die, but ſomething flatter, black on the one ſide and white on the other, which they place on the Ground, againſt which violently thumping the Platter, the Bones mount, changing colours with the windy whisking of their Hands to and fro; which action in that ſport they much uſe, ſmiting themſelves on the Beaſt and Thighs, crying out <hi>Hub, Hub, Hub;</hi> they may be heard play at this Game a quarter of a Mile off: The Bones being all black or white make a double Game; if three of one colour, and two of another, then they afford but a ſingle Game; four, of a colour, and one differing, is nothing; ſo long as the Man wins he keeps the Tray, but if he looſe the next Man takes it. They are ſo bewitch'd with theſe two Games, that they will loſe ſometimes all they have; Beaver, <hi>Mooſe</hi>-skins, Kettles, <hi>Wampompeage, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whacks,</hi> Hatchets, Knives, all is confiſcate by theſe two Games. For their Sports of
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:56274:94"/>action they have commonly but three or four, as Football, Shooting, Running, and Swimming; when they play Countrey againſt Countrey, there are rich Goals, all behung with <hi>Wampompeage, Mowhacks,</hi> Beaver Skins, and black Otter Skins: Their Goals are a Mile long plac'd on the Sands, which are as even as a Board; their Ball is no bigger than a Hand-ball, which ſometimes they mount in the Air with their naked Feet, ſometimes it is ſway'd by the multitude, ſometime alſo it is two days before they get a Goal, then they mark the Ground they win, and begin there the next day. Before they come to this Sport they paint themſelves, even as when they go to War, in policy to prevent future miſchief, becauſe no man ſhould know him that mov'd his patience, or accidentally hurt his Perſon, taking away the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of ſtudying revenge. Before they begin, their Arms are put off, and hung upon ſome neighboring Tree, after which they make a long ſcrowl on the Sand, over which they ſhake Hands, and with loving Hearts ſcuffle for Victory. While the Men Play, the Boys Pipe, and the Women Dance and Sing Trophies of their Husbands Conqueſts; all being done, a Feaſt ſummons their departure.</p>
               <p>Such is their dexterity in Shooting, that they can hit a running Hind, or flying Pigeon, without a ſtanding pauſe or left-ey'd blinking; they draw their Arrows between their Fingers and the Thumb; their Bowes are quick, but not very ſtrong, not killing at above ſix or ſeven ſcore diſtance: Shooting at one another, they have a trick with ſwift conveyance to ſhun the Arrow; this they do to make them expert againſt time of War. They are train'd up to their Bowes even from their Childhood; for little Boys with Bowes made of little Sticks, and Arrows made of great Bents, will hit down a piece of Tobacco-pipe every time a good way off. As theſe <hi>Indians</hi> are good Marks-men, ſo are they well experienc'd where the very Life of every Creature lieth, and know where to ſmite him to make him die preſently. Their Swimming is not after our <hi>Engliſh</hi> faſhion, of ſpread Arms and Legs, which they hold too tireſom, but like Dogs, their Arms before them, cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting through the Liquids with their right Shoulder: In this manner they will Swim very ſwift and far, either in rough or ſmooth Waters, ſometimes for their eaſe lying as ſtill as a Log; ſometimes they will play the Dive-doppers, and come up in unexpected places.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Of their Huntings.</note>For their Hunting, it is to be noted, that they have no ſwift-footed Greyhounds to let ſlip at the ſight of the Deer, no deep-mouth'd Hounds, or ſcenting Beagles, to find out their deſired Prey; themſelves are all this, who in that time of the year when the Deer comes down, having certain Hunting-houſes in ſuch places where they know the Deer doth uſually frequent, in which they keep their Rendezvouz, their Snares, and all their Accoutrements for that Employment: when they get ſight of a Deer, <hi>Mooſe,</hi> or Bear, they ſtudy how to get the Wind of him, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching within ſhot, ſtab their Mark quite through, if the Bones hinder not. The chief thing they Hunt after is Deer, <hi>Mooſes</hi> and Bears: It grieves them more to ſee an <hi>Engliſh</hi>-man take one Deer, than a thouſand Acres of Land. They Hunt likewiſe after Wolves, wild Cats, <hi>Rackoons,</hi> Otters, Beavers, and <hi>Muſquashes,</hi> Trading both their Skins and Fleſh to the <hi>English.</hi> Beſide this Artillery they have other devices to kill their Game, as ſometimes Hedges, a Mile or two Miles long, being a Mile wide at one end, and made narrower and narrower by degrees, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving onely a Gap of ſix Foot long; over againſt which in the day-time they lie lurking, to ſhoot the Deer which come through that narrow paſſage; ſo many as come within the circumference of that Hedge, ſeldom return back to leap over, unleſs they be forc'd by the chaſing of ſome ravenous Wolf, or ſight of ſome acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental Paſſenger: In the Night, at the Gap of this Hedge, they ſet Deer-traps,
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:56274:94"/>which are Springes made of young Trees, and ſmooth wrought Cords, ſo ſtrong, that it will toſs a Horſe if he be caught in it.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Of their Fiſhings.</note>In the Trade of Fiſhing they are very expert, being experienc'd in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of all Baits for ſeveral Fiſhes, and divers Seaſons; being not ignorant like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe of the removal of Fiſhes, knowing when to Fiſh in Rivers, and when at Rocks, when in Bays, and when at Seas: Since the <hi>English</hi> came they are furniſh'd with <hi>English</hi> Hooks and Lines, for before they made them of Hemp, being more curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly wrought, of ſtronger Materials than ours, and hook'd with Bone-Hooks; but lazineſs drives them to buy, more than profit or commendations wins them to make of their own. They make likewiſe very ſtrong Sturgeon-nets, with which they catch Sturgeons of twelve, fourteen, and ſixteen, and ſome eighteen Foot long in the day-time, and in the night-time they betake themſelves to their Birchen <hi>Canoos,</hi> in which they carry a forty-fathom Line, with a ſharp-bearded Dart faſtned at the end thereof; then lighting a Torch made of Birchen Rinds, they wave it to and again by their <hi>Canoo</hi> ſide, which the Sturgeon much delighted with, comes to them tumbling and playing, turning up his white Belly, into which they thruſt their Lance, his Back being impenetrable; which done, they hale to the Shore their ſtrugling Prize. They have often recourſe into the Rocks whereupon the Sea beats, in warm Weather, to look out for ſleepy Seals, whoſe Oyl they much eſteem, uſing it for divers things. In Summer they Fiſh any where, but in Winter in the freſh Water onely, and Ponds; in froſty Weather they cut round Holes in the Ice, about which they will ſit like ſo many Apes with their naked Breeches upon the cold Ice, catching of Pikes, Pearches, Breams, and other ſorts of freſh-Water Fiſh.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Of their Arts and Mantifa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures.</note>Their Arts and Manufactures are divers, as firſt their dreſſing of all manner of Skins, which they do by ſcraping and rubbing, afterwards painting them with antique Embroiderings in unchangeable Colours; ſometimes they take off the Hair, eſpecially if it be not kill'd in ſeaſon. Their Bowes they make of a handſom ſhape, ſtrung commonly with the Sinews of <hi>Mooſes;</hi> their Arrows of young Elder, feather'd with Feathers of Eagles Wings and Tails, headed with Braſs in ſhape of a Heart or Triangle, faſtned in a ſlender piece of Wood ſix or eight Inches long, which is fram'd to put looſe in the pithy Elder, aftewards bound faſt for riving: Their Arrows are made in this manner, becauſe it might ſhake from his Head, and be left behind for their finding, and the Pile onely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main to gaul the wounded Beaſt. Their Cordage is ſo even, ſoft, and ſmooth, that it looks more like Silk than Hemp. Their Sturgeon Nets are not deep, nor above thirty or forty Foot long; which in ebbing low Waters they ſtake faſt to the Ground where they are ſure the Sturgeon will come, never looking more at it till the next low Water. Their <hi>Canoos</hi> are made either of Pine-trees, which before they were acquainted with <hi>English</hi> Tools, they burn'd hollow, ſcraping them ſmooth with Clam-ſhells and Oyſter-ſhells, cutting their out-ſides With Stone Hatchets. Theſe Boats are not above a Foot and a half, or two Foot wide, and twenty Foot long. Their other <hi>Canoos</hi> be made of thin Birch Rinds, cloſe Ribb'd, and on the in-ſide with broad thin Hoops, like the Hoops of a Tub; theſe are made very light, a Man may carry one of them a Mile, being made purpoſely to carry from River to River, and from Bay to Bay, to ſhorten Land-paſſages. In theſe cockling Fly-boats, wherein an <hi>English</hi>-man can ſcarce ſit without a fearful tottering, they will venture to Sea, when an <hi>English</hi> Shallop dare not bear a Knot of Sail, ſcudding over the over-grown Waves as faſt as a wind-driven Ship, being driven by their Paddles, being much like Battle-doors; if a croſs Wave (which is ſeldom) turn her Keel up-ſide down, they by ſwimming free her, and ſcramble into her again.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Of their Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage.</note>Their Language, is onely peculiar to themſelves, not inclining to any of the more refined Tongues. Some have thought they might be of the diſperſed <hi>Jews,</hi> becauſe ſome of their words are near unto the <hi>Hebrew;</hi> but by the ſame rule they may conclude them to be ſome of the gleanings of all Nations, becauſe they have words which ſound after the <hi>Greek, Latine, French,</hi> and other Tongues. Their Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage is hard to learn, few of the <hi>English</hi> being able to ſpeak any of it, or capable of the right pronunciation, which is the chief grace of their Tongue: They pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce much after the Diphthongs, excluding <hi>L</hi> and <hi>R,</hi> which in our <hi>English</hi> Tongue they pronounce with as much difficulty, as moſt of the <hi>Dutch</hi> do <hi>T</hi> and <hi>H,</hi> calling a Lobſter a <hi>Nobſtann.</hi> Every Countrey doth ſomething differ in their Speech, even as our Northern People do from the Southern, and Weſtern from them; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the <hi>Tarrentine,</hi> whoſe Tongue runs ſo much upon <hi>R,</hi> that they wharle much in pronunciation. When any Ships come near the Shore, they demand whether they are King <hi>Charles</hi>'s <hi>Torries,</hi> with ſuch a rumbling ſound, as if one were beating on an unbrac'd Drum. In ſerious Diſcourſe our Southern <hi>Indians</hi> uſe ſeldom any ſhort Colloquies, but ſpeak their minds at large, without any interjected Diſcourſes from any, the reſt giving diligent audience to his utterance; which done, ſome or other returns him as long an Anſwer: They love not to ſpeak <hi>multa, ſed multum;</hi> ſeldom are their words and their deeds ſtrangers.

In Summer they gather Flags, of which they make Mats for Houſes, and Hemp and Ruſhes, with Dying Stuff, of which they make curious Baskets, with intermixed Colours and Pourtraictures of antique Imagery. Theſe Baskets are of all ſizes from a Quart to a Quarter, in which they carry their Luggage.

               <p>One of the great Lakes is call'd <hi>The Lake of Troquois,</hi> which together with a Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of the ſame Name, running into the River of <hi>Canada,</hi> is ſixty or ſeventy Leagues in length.</p>
               <p>In the Lake are four fair Iſlands, which are low and full of goodly Woods and Meadows, having ſtore of Game for Hunting, as Stags, Fallow-Deer, Elks, Roe-Bucks, Beavers, and other ſorts of Beaſts which come from the Main Land to the ſaid Iſlands.</p>
               <p>The Rivers which fall into the Lakes have in them good ſtore of Beavers; of which Beaſts, as alſo of the Elks, the Salvages make their chiefeſt Traffick.</p>
               <p>The ſaid Iſlands have been inhabited heretofore by the Salvages, but are now abandon'd by reaſon of their late Wars one with another: They contain twelve or fifteen Leagues in length, and are ſeated commodiouſly for Habitation in the midſt of the Lake, which abounds with divers kinds of wholeſom Fiſh.</p>
               <p>From this Lake run two Rivers Southward, which fall into the Eaſtern and Southern Sea-Coaſt of <hi>New England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Into this Lake there went many years ſince certain <hi>French</hi> of <hi>Quebeck,</hi> who ſided with the <hi>Algovinquins,</hi> with the help of their <hi>Canoos,</hi> which they carried the ſpace of five Miles over the <hi>Impoſsible Falls,</hi> to Fight a Battel in revenge of ſome former In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries done by the <hi>Troquois</hi> to the <hi>Algovinquins,</hi> who had the Victory; for which cauſe the <hi>French</hi> have been ſo hated ever ſince by the Nation of the <hi>Troquois,</hi> that none of them durſt ever appear in any part of that Lake. But their Trade, ſaid to be ſixteen thouſand Beavers yearly, is partly ſold to the <hi>Dutch,</hi> who Trade with the Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>end of the ſaid Lake over Land by Horſes, from their Plantation upon <hi>Hudſon</hi>'s <hi>River:</hi> and another part is conceiv'd to be purchas'd by the <hi>Hiroons,</hi> who being Newters, are Friends both to the one and the other; and theſe <hi>Hiroons</hi> bring down the greateſt part of all by the River of <hi>Canada.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Way over Land to this great Lake, from the Plantation of <hi>Paſcataway,</hi> hath been attempted by Captain <hi>Walter Neale,</hi> once Governor, at the Charges of Sir <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinando Gorges,</hi> Captain <hi>Maſon,</hi> and ſome Merchants of <hi>London,</hi> and the Diſcovery wanted but one days Journey of finiſhing, becauſe their Victuals was ſpent, which, for want of Horſes, they were enforc'd to carry with their Arms, and their Clothes, upon their Backs: They intended to have made a ſettlement for Trade by Pinnaces upon the ſaid Lake, which they reckon to be about ninety or a hundred Miles from the Plantation over Land.</p>

               <p>The People of the Countrey are given to Hunting of wild Beaſts, which is their chiefeſt Food.</p>
               <p>Their Arms are Bowes and Arrows. Their Armor is made partly of Wood, and partly of a kind of twiſted Stuff like Cotton-Wool.</p>
               <p>Their Meat is Flour of <hi>Indian</hi> Corn, of that Countreys growth, ſodden to Pap, which they preſerve for times of Neceſſity when they cannot Hunt.</p>

They are in the firſt place very ſlovenly and naſty, ſtubborn, covetous, revengeful, and much addicted to filching and ſtealing.

Their Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings being improv'd by the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> they are quick of apprehenſion, to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh good from bad: they will not endure any Oppreſſion, but are very patient of Heat,<note place="margin">Strange Stoves.</note> Cold, Hunger and Thirſt.

A ſick Perſon coming into the ſame, ſets himſelf down, and places hot Stones round about him; which done, and having ſweat a conſiderable time, he leaps into cold Water, by which he finds eaſe of all his Diſtempers.</p>
                  <p>Though theſe People know no great diſtinction between Man and Man, as other Nations, yet they have noble and ignoble Families amongſt them; ſuperior and inferior Offices, which they enjoy by Inheritance; but ſometimes the Martial Offices are beſtowed according to the Valour of the Perſons: Their Generals ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom give their Enemies a Field-Battel, by drawing or dividing their Men into Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giments or Companies, but make it their whole Deſign to defeat their Enemies by ſudden Sallies from Ambuſcado's; for they never ſtand out a cloſe Fight, unleſs compell'd to it, but if encompaſs'd round, they fight to the laſt Man. When any danger threatens, the Women and Children are convey'd to a ſecure place. Their Arms formerly were Bowes and Arrows,<note place="margin">Arms.</note> and Battel-axes, but now they uſe Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quets, which they have learn'd to-handle with great dexterity. Their ſquare Shields cover all their Bodies and Shoulders. About their Heads they tie a Snakes Skin, in the middle of which ſticks either a Fox's or Bear's Tail.

It de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſences no ſmall admiration, that the Sufferer during the whole time of his Torture, Sings till he breathes his laſt.

If any one murther or kill the other, the Relations of the ſlain, if they can take the Malefactor in twenty four hours, may without Examination or delay put him to death alſo; but that time being once expir'd, the Revenger is liable to be kill'd in the ſame time by his Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions whom he ſlew. All Obligations have their power and vertue from certain Preſents deliver'd upon the making of a Contract, which is done thus: They dry as many Sticks as they have Articles, which if they agree upon, every Man on the concluding of the Diſcourſe lays a Preſent before the others Feet. Sometimes they hang up the Preſents, becauſe they are often three days in Conſultation before they reſolve; after which if the Preſents be taken down, it is a certain ſign of their Agreement; but if not, they proceed no farther, unleſs the Articles and Preſents are alter'd.

                     <q>IF there be any terreſtrial happineſs (ſaith he) to be had by any People, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally of an inferior rank, it muſt certainly be here. Here any one may furniſh himſelf with Land, and live Rent-free, yea, with ſuch a quantity of Land, that he may weary himſelf with walking over his Fields of Corn, and all ſorts of Grain, and let his Stock amount to ſome hundreds; he needs not fear there want of Paſture in the Summer, or Fodder in the Winter, the Woods affording ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ſupply, where you have Graſs as high as a Man's Knees, nay, as high as his Waſte, interlac'd with Pea-Vines, and other Weeds that Cattel much delight in, as much as a Man can paſs through: And theſe Woods alſo every Mile or half-Mile are furniſh'd with freſh Ponds, Brooks, or Rivers, where all ſorts of Cattel, during the heat of the day, do quench their thirſt, and cool themſelves. Theſe Brooks and Rivers being inviron'd of each ſide with ſeveral ſorts of Trees and Grape-Vines, Arbor-like interchanging places, and croding theſe Rivers, do ſhade and ſhelter them from the ſcorching beams of the Sun. Such as by their utmoſt Labors can ſcarcely get a Living, may here procure Inheritances of Lands and Poſſeſſions, ſtock themſelves with all ſorts of Cattel, enjoy the benefit of them whilſt they live, and leave them to their Children when they die. Here you need not trouble the Shambles for Meat, nor Bakers and Brewers for Beer and Bread, nor run to a Linnen-Draper for a ſupply, every one making their own Linnen, and a great part of their woollen Cloth for their ordinary wearing. And how prodigal (if I may ſo ſay) hath Nature been to furniſh this Countrey with all ſorts of wild Beaſts and Fowl, which every one hath an intereſt in, and may Hunt at his pleaſure; where, beſides the pleaſure in Hunting, he may furniſh his Houſe with excellent fat Veniſon, Turkies, Geeſe, Heath-hens, Cranes, Swans, Ducks, Pigeons, and the like; and wearied with that, he may go a Fiſhing, where the Rivers are ſo furniſh'd, that he may ſupply himſelf with Fiſh before he can leave off the Recreation. Here one may travel by Land upon the ſame Continent hundreds of Miles, and paſs through Towns and Villages, and never hear the leaſt complaint for want, nor hear any ask him for a Farthing. Here one may lodge in the Fields and Woods, travel from one end of the Countrey to another, with as much ſecurity as if he were lock'd within his own Chamber: And if one chance to meet with an <hi>Indian</hi> Town, they ſhall give him the beſt Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they have, and upon his deſire direct him on his Way. But that which adds happineſs to all the reſt, is the healthfulneſs of the Place, where many Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in twenty years time never know what Sickneſs is; where they look upon it as a great Mortality, if two or three die out of a Town in a years time. Beſides the ſweetneſs of the Air, the Countrey it ſelf ſends forth ſuch a fragrant ſmell, that it may be perceiv'd at Sea before they can make the Land: No evil Fog or Vapor doth any ſooner appear, but a North-Weſt or Weſterly Wind immediately diſſolves it, and drives it away. Moreover, you ſhall ſcarce ſee a Houſe, but the South-ſide is begirt with Hives of Bees, which increaſe after an incredible man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: So that if there be any terreſtrial <hi>Canaan,</hi> 'tis ſurely here, where the Land floweth with Milk and Honey.</q>

                  <p>Thus this Province at the vaſt Charges, and by the unweary'd Induſtry and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavor of the preſent Lord <hi>Baltemore,</hi> the now abſolute Lord and Proprietary of the ſame was at firſt Planted , and hath ſince been ſupply'd with People and other Neceſſaries, ſo effectually,<note place="margin">The number of Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants.</note> that in this preſent Year 1671. the number of <hi>English</hi> there amounts to fifteen or twenty thouſand Inhabitants, for whoſe Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment there is a Fundamental Law eſtabliſh'd there by his Lordſhip, whereby <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of Conſcience</hi> is allow'd to all that Profeſs to believe in <hi>Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> ſo that no Man who is a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> is in danger of being diſturb'd for his Religion; and all Perſons being ſatisfi'd touching his Lordſhips Right, as Granted by his Superior So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign, the King of <hi>Great Brittain,</hi> and poſſeſs'd by the conſent and agreement of the firſt <hi>Indian</hi> Owners, every Perſon who repaireth thither, intending to become an Inhabitant, finds himſelf ſecure, as well in the quiet enjoyment of his Property, as of his Conſcience.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Charles Calvert,</hi> his Lordſhips onely Son and Heir, was in the Year 1661. ſent thither by his Lordſhip to Govern this Province and People, who hath hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto continu'd that Charge of his Lordſhips Lieutenant there, to the general ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction and encouragement of all Perſons under his Government, or otherwiſe concern'd in the Province.</p>
                  <p>The precedent Diſcourſe having given you a ſhort Deſcription of this Province from its Infancy to this day, together with an account of his Lordſhips Patent and Right, by which he holds the ſame; we will here ſpeak ſomething of the Nature of the Countrey in general, and of the Commodities that are either naturally afforded there, or may be procur'd by Induſtry.</p>
                  <p>The Climate is very healthful, and agreeable with <hi>English</hi> Conſtitutions; but New-comers have moſt of them heretofore had the firſt year of their Planting there in <hi>July</hi> and <hi>Auguſt,</hi> a Sickneſs, which is call'd there <hi>A Seaſoning,</hi> but is indeed no other than an Ague, with cold and hot Fits, whereof many heretofore us'd to die for want of good Medicines, and accommodations of Diet and Lodging, and by drinking too much Wine and Strong-waters; though many, even in thoſe times, who were more temperate, and that were better accommodated, never had any <hi>Seaſonings</hi> at all; but of late years, ſince the Countrey hath been more open'd by the cutting down of the Woods, and that there is more plenty of <hi>English</hi> Diet, there are very few die of thoſe Agues, and many have no <hi>Seaſonings</hi> at all, eſpecially thoſe that live in the higher parts of the Country, and not near to the Marſhes and Salt-water.</p>
                  <p>In Summer, the heats are equal to thoſe of <hi>Spain,</hi> but qualifi'd daily about Noon, at that time of the Year, either with ſome gentle Breezes, or ſmall Showres of Rain: In Winter there is Froſt and Snow, and ſometimes it is extremely cold, inſomuch, that the Rivers and the Northerly part of the Bay of <hi>Cheſapeack</hi> are Fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen, but it ſeldom laſts long; and ſome Winters are ſo warm, that People have gone in half Shirts and Drawers only at <hi>Chriſtmas:</hi> But in the Spring and Autumn, (<hi>viz.</hi>) in <hi>March, April,</hi> and <hi>May, September, October,</hi> and <hi>November,</hi> there is generally
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:56274:114"/>moſt pleaſant temperate Weather: The Winds there are variable, from the South comes Heat, Guſts, and Thunder; from the North or North-Weſt, cold Weather; and in Winter, Froſt and Snow; from the Eaſt and South-Eaſt, Rain.</p>
                  <p>The Soyl is very fertile, and furniſh'd with many pleaſant and commodious Rivers, Creeks, and Harbors.</p>
                  <p>The Country is generally plain and even, and yet diſtinguiſh'd with ſome pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſmall Hills and Riſings, with variety of Springs and Rivulets: The Woods are for the moſt part free from Underwood, ſo that a Man may Travel or Hunt for his Recreation.</p>
                  <p>The ordinary entrance by Sea into this Country is between two <hi>Capes,</hi> diſtant each from the other about ſeven or eight Leagues; the South <hi>Cape</hi> is call'd <hi>Cape Henry;</hi> the North, <hi>Cape Charles;</hi> within the <hi>Capes</hi> you enter into a fair <hi>Bay,</hi> Navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gable for at leaſt two hundred Miles, and is call'd <hi>Cheſapeack Bay;</hi> ſtretching it ſelf Northerly through the heart of the Countrey, which adds much to its Fame and Value: Into this Bay fall many ſtately Rivers, the chief whereof is <hi>Patomeck,</hi> which is Navigable for at leaſt a hundred and forty Miles: The next Northward, is <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuxent,</hi> at its entrance diſtant from the other about twenty Miles, a River yielding great Profit as well as Pleaſure to the Inhabitants; and by reaſon of the Iſlands and other places of advantage that may Command it, both fit for Habitation and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence: Paſſing hence to the Head of the Bay, you meet with ſeveral pleaſant and commodious Rivers, which for brevity we here omit to give any particular ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of: On the Eaſtern Shore are ſeveral commodious Rivers, Harbors, Creeks, and Iſlands; to the Northward whereof you enter into another fair Bay, call'd <hi>Delaware Bay;</hi> wide at its entrance about eight Leagues, and into which falls a very fair Navigable River.</p>

                  <p>The Sea, the Bays of <hi>Cheſapeack</hi> and <hi>Delaware,</hi> and generally all the Rivers, do abound with Fiſh of ſeveral ſorts; as Whales, Sturgeon, Thorn-back, Grampuſes, Porpuſes, Mullets, Trouts, Soules, Plaice, Mackrel, Perch, Eels, Roach, Shadd, Herrings, Crabs, Oyſters, Cockles, Muſſels, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but above all theſe, the Fiſh where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of there are none in <hi>England,</hi> as <hi>Drums, Sheeps-head, Cat-fish, &amp;c.</hi> are beſt, except Stur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon, which are there found in great abundance, not inferior to any in <hi>Europe</hi> for largeneſs and goodneſs.</p>

                  <p>The Soyl is generally very rich, the Mould in many places black and rank, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch, that it is neceſſary to Plant it firſt with <hi>Indian</hi> Corn, Tobacco, or Hemp, before it is fit for <hi>English</hi> Grain; under that is found good <hi>Loam,</hi> whereof has been made as good Brick as any in <hi>Europe:</hi> There are ſtore of Marſh-grounds for Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows; great plenty of Marle, both blue and white; excellent Clay for Pots and Tiles: To conclude, there is nothing that can be reaſonably expected, in a place lying in the ſame Latitude with this, but what is either there found naturally, or may be procur'd by Induſtry, as Oranges, Lemons, and Olives, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  <p>There is a great quantity of Syder made there at preſent, and as good as in any other Countrey; good Perry and Quince-drink is there likewiſe made in great plenty: The Ground doth naturally bring forth Vines in great quantities, the quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

                  <p>Moſt of their Governments are Monarchical, (except the <hi>Saſquabanocks,</hi> which is a Re-publick) but for ſucceſſion they have a peculiar Cuſtom, that the Iſſue of the Males never ſucceed, but the Iſſue-Male of the Female ſucceed in Government, as the ſurer ſide: They all ſubmit to, and are protected by the Lord Proprietaries Government; and in caſe of any Aſſault or Murder, committed on any <hi>Engliſh,</hi> the Party offending is try'd by the Laws of the Province; and in caſe of any new Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of King or Emperor among them, they preſent the Perſon ſo Elected to the Governor for the time being, who as he ſees cauſe, either alters or confirms their Choice.</p>

                  <p>They pay great Reſpect and Obedience to their Kings and Superiors, whoſe Commands they immediately Execute, though with an apparent hazard of their Lives.</p>
                  <p>The Mens chief employment is Hunting, and the Wars, in both which they commonly uſe Bowes and Arrows; ſome of late have Guns and other Weapons, by a private Trade with ſome <hi>Engliſh</hi> Neighboring Plantations: They are excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:56274:116"/>Marks-men, it being the onely thing they breed their Youth to: The Women Plant and look after the Corn, make their Bread, and dreſs what Proviſions their Husbands bring home. Their way of Marriage is by agreement with the Womens Parents or Friends, who for a certain Sum of their Money, or other Goods, deliver her to the Man at a day appointed, which is commonly ſpent in jollity.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>In Affairs of concern, they are very conſiderate, and uſe few words in declaring their intentions; for at Mr. <hi>Leonard Calverts</hi> firſt arrival there, the <hi>Werowance</hi> of <hi>Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catoway</hi> being ask'd by him, <hi>Whether he would be content, that the</hi> Engliſh <hi>ſhould fit down in his Countrey?</hi> return'd this anſwer, <hi>That he would not bid him go, neither would he bid him ſtay, but that he might uſe his own diſcretion.</hi> Theſe were their expreſſions to the Governor at his firſt entrance into <hi>Mary-land,</hi> whom then they were jealous of, whether he might prove a Friend or a Neighbor, but by his diſcreet Demeanor to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them at firſt, and friendly uſage of them afterwards, they are now become, not only civil, but ſerviceable to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> there upon all occaſions.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Indians</hi> of the Eaſtern ſhore are moſt numerous, and were formerly very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fractory, whom Mr. <hi>Leonard Calvert</hi> ſome few years after his firſt ſettling the Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, was forc'd to reduce, and of late the Emperor of <hi>Nanticoke,</hi> and his Men were deſervedly defeated by the preſent Governor, Mr. <hi>Charles Calvert,</hi> who reduc'd him about the year 1668. which has ſince tam'd the ruder ſort of the neighboring <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> who now by experience, find it better to ſubmit and be protected by the Lord

                  <p>Theſe People live under no Law, but that of Nature and Reaſon, which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding leads them to the acknowledgement of a Deity, whom they own to be the Giver of all good things, wherewith their Life is maintain'd, and to him they Sacrifice the firſt Fruits of the Earth, and of that which they acquire by Hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Fiſhing: The Sacrifice is perform'd by their Prieſts, who are commonly ancient Men, and profeſs themſelves Conjurers; they firſt make a Speech to their God, then burn part, and eat and diſtribute the reſt among them that are preſent; until this Ceremony be ended, they will not touch one bit thereof; they hold the Immortality of the Soul, and that there is a place of Joy, and another of Torment after Death, prepar'd for every one according to their Merits.</p>
                  <p>They bury their Dead with ſtrange expreſſions of Sorrow (the better ſort upon a Scaffold, erected for that end) whom they leave cover'd with Mats, and return when his fleſh is conſum'd to Interr his Bones; the common ſort are committed to the Earth without that Ceremony; but they never omit to bury ſome part of their Wealth, Arms, and Houſhold-ſtuff with the Corps.</p>

Anchor'd at <hi>Wokokon,</hi> but made their firſt Seat at <hi>Roanoack</hi> on <hi>Auguſt</hi> 17. following, which lies in thirty ſix Degrees of Northerly Latitude, or thereabouts, where they continu'd till <hi>June</hi> 1586. during which time they made ſeveral Diſcoveries in the Continent and adjacent Iſlands; and being endanger'd by the treachery of the Salvages, return'd for <hi>England,</hi> and Landed at <hi>Portſmouth</hi> on <hi>July</hi> 27. following.</p>
                  <p>Sir <hi>Walter Rawleigh</hi> and his Aſſociates, in the year 1586. ſent a Ship to relieve that Colony, which had deſerted the Countrey ſome while before, and were all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd for <hi>England</hi> as is before-mention'd.</p>

                  <p>The year following, Mr. <hi>John White,</hi> with three Ships, came to ſearch for the fifty <hi>Engliſh</hi> at <hi>Roanoack,</hi> but found them not, they having been ſet upon by the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, and diſpers'd ſo, as no News could be heard of them, and in their room left a hundred and fifty more to continue that Plantation.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>Auguſt</hi> 1589. Mr. <hi>John White</hi> went thither again, to ſearch for the laſt Colony which he had left there; but not finding them, return'd for <hi>England</hi> in <hi>Septemb.</hi> 6. 1590.</p>
                  <p>This ill Succeſs made all further Diſcoveries to be laid aſide, till Captain <hi>Goſnol</hi> on <hi>March</hi> 26. 1602. ſet Sail from <hi>Dartmouth,</hi> and on <hi>May</hi> 11. following, made Land at a place, where ſome <hi>Biſcaners,</hi> as he gueſs'd by the Natives information, had formerly fiſh'd, being about the Latitude of forty eight Degrees Northerly Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude; from hence putting to Sea, he made Diſcovery of an Iſland which he call'd <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thas Vineyard,</hi> and ſhortly after of <hi>Elizabeth's</hi> Iſle, and ſo return'd for <hi>England, June</hi> 18. following.</p>

                  <p>

                     </note>Whilſt the Town was rebuilding, <hi>Smith</hi> ſet Sail in an open Barque with fourteen Men, and diſcover'd two Iſles before <hi>Point Charles,</hi> to which he gave his Name; then ran into the Inlet <hi>Cheſapeack,</hi> in the midſt of which lay ſeveral Iſlands,<note place="margin">His remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploits.</note> by the Sea-men call'd <hi>Ruſſels.</hi> Before the River <hi>Wighcomoco</hi> they found a diſturbed Sea, and more Northerly a Bay with freſh and hot Water, and at laſt he met with two <hi>Virgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi> which conducted the <hi>Engliſh</hi> along a Creek to <hi>Onawmoment,</hi> where ſome hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds of them lay in Ambuſcade, according to <hi>Powhatan</hi>'s appointment, to cut off <hi>Smith;</hi> who leaping forth on a Hidden appear'd like Devils, all painted but the Bullets flying about made them all run away. <hi>Smith,</hi> whoſe Deſign was onely to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the Countrey, and the Silver Mine of <hi>Patawomeck,</hi> ten Leagues up into the Countrey, found the Metal to be of little value, ſo that he return'd with little Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, being newly cur'd of a poyſonous Wound in the Arm, which was given him by a Fiſh not unlike a Shark, whilſt he lay aground near <hi>Toppahanock.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A while after being inform'd of <hi>Powhatan</hi>'s Deſign to deſtroy the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> (though he had been lately Preſented by <hi>Newport</hi> with a Silver Baſin, a rich Chair, Bed, and Furniture belonging to it, with other things of value) he, to prevent him, choſe forty eight out of two hundred Men which were Garriſon'd in <hi>James-Town,</hi> then going to <hi>Werowocomoco,</hi> Landed with much trouble, the River being frozen above half a Mile from the Shore.</p>
                  <p>A <hi>German</hi> Soldier amongſt <hi>Smith</hi>'s Company giving private notice to <hi>Powhatan</hi> of the Deſign of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> made his Eſcape by flight: But <hi>Smith</hi> going on to <hi>Pamaunke,</hi> found King <hi>Opechancangough</hi> with ſeven hundred Men in Arms, threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning a fierce Battel; but <hi>Smith</hi> making directly up to him, ſet his Piſtol on his Breaſt, and forc'd him to lay down his Arms. <hi>Powhatan</hi> by this time provided with Swords and Muſquets by two <hi>Dutch</hi>-men, alſo began to beſtir himſelf afreſh; but his Intentions being too ſoon known, he was again quieted, and forc'd a ſecond time to ſend <hi>Smith</hi> a String of Pearl; after which a Peace was concluded between all the Natives and the <hi>Engliſh.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Many other Quarrels and Encounters there were in the Infancy of the Planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion between the <hi>Indians</hi> and the <hi>English,</hi> wherein it would be endleſs to recount all the Treacheries and Ambuſcades of the Salvages, ſome of which had prov'd very pernicious to the Planters, had they not been betray'd to Captain <hi>Smith</hi> by <hi>Poca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honta,</hi> King <hi>Powhatan</hi>'s Daughter, who upon all occaſions ſhew'd her ſelf a great Friend to the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> having ſav'd the Captain's Life, when, being her Father's Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner, he was juſt brought to Execution.</p>
                  <p>This Lady was afterwards brought into <hi>England,</hi> Chriſtned by the Name of <hi>Rebekah,</hi> and Married to one Mr. <hi>Rolf,</hi> and died at <hi>Graveſend</hi> in an intended Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age back to her own Countrey.</p>
                  <p>Nor did their Cruelties and Treacheries end when the Plantation came to be more ſetled, for on the two and twentieth of <hi>March</hi> about the Year 1621. in the time of Sir <hi>Francis Wyat</hi>'s Government, they generally combin'd to deſtroy all the <hi>Engliſh</hi> there; and carried on this deviliſh Deſign with ſuch diſſimulation and dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity, that in one day they cut off ſeven hundred Men, Women, and Children, there being at that time not above fifteen hundred in the Countrey.</p>
                  <p>Since which time, in the Year of our Lord 1643. there hapned another bloody
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:56274:124"/>Maſſacre, wherein near five hundred <hi>Engliſh</hi> were in one Night miſerably butcher'd by thoſe barbarous and perfidious Salvages: whoſe Blood the preſent Governor, Sir <hi>William Berkley,</hi> nobly and juſtly reveng'd the Year following, utterly deſtroying moſt of them, and taking Priſoner their chief Emperor, <hi>Opichancono,</hi> who died not long after in Priſon.</p>
                  <p>Having given but a ſmall hint, in its proper place, of the Story of Captain <hi>Smith</hi>'s Impriſonment by <hi>Powhatan,</hi> and his deliverance from Death by <hi>Pocahonta;</hi> we have thought not improper to reſerve the Story of it, being very remarkable for a particular Relation, before we conclude our Deſcription of <hi>Virginia,</hi> ſince otherwiſe we ſhould have interrupted the Series of our former Diſcourſe.</p>

                     <p>THe Salvages having drawn from one <hi>George Caſſen,</hi> whither Captain <hi>Smith</hi> was gone, proſecuting that opportunity, they follow'd him with three hundred Bowe-Men, conducted by the King of <hi>Pamaunkee,</hi> who in diviſions, ſearching the turnings of the River, found two of his Men by the fire ſide, whom they ſhot full of Arrows, and ſlew. Then finding the Captain, who, as is ſaid, us'd the Salvage that was his Guide as his Shield, (three of them being ſlain, and others ſore gall'd) the reſt would not come near him: Thinking thus to have return'd to his Boat, regarding them as he march'd, more than his way, he ſlipp'd up to the middle in an Oſier-Creek, and his Salvage-with him, yet durſt they not come to him, till being near dead with cold, he threw away his Arms: Then according to their compoſition, they drew him forth, and led him to the Fire, where his Men were ſlain; diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they chaf'd his benumm'd Limbs, he demanding for their Captain, they ſhew'd him <hi>Opechankanough,</hi> King of <hi>Pamaunkee,</hi> to whom he gave a round Ivory double compaſs Dyal. Much they marvel'd at the playing of the Fly and Needle, which they could ſee ſo plainly, and yet not touch it, becauſe of the Glaſs that cover'd them; but when he demonſtrated by that Globe-like Jewel, the roundneſs of the Earth, and Skies; the Sphere of the Sun, Moon, and Stars, and how the Sun did chaſe the Night round about the World continually; the greatneſs of the Land and Sea; the diverſity of Nations, variety of Complexions, and how we were to them <hi>Antipodes,</hi> and many other ſuch like matters, they all ſtood as amaz'd with admiration: Notwithſtanding, within an hour after they ty'd him to a Tree, and as many as could ſtand about him prepar'd to ſhoot him; but the King holding up the Compaſs in his Hand, they all laid down their Bowes and Arrows, and in a triumphant manner led him to <hi>Orapaks,</hi> where he was after their manner kindly Feaſted, and well us'd.</p>
                     <p>Their order in conducting him was thus; Drawing themſelves all in Fyle, the King in the midſt had all their Bowes and Swords borne before him. Captain <hi>Smith</hi> was led after him by three great Salvages, holding him faſt by each Arm; and on each ſide ſix went in Fyle with their Arrows nocked. But arriving at the Town (which was but onely thirty or forty Hunting Houſes made of Mats, which they remove as they pleaſe, as we our Tents) all the Women and Children ſtaring and gazing at him, the Souldiers firſt all in Fyle wheel'd off to the Rear in good Order; on each Flank were Officers, like Serjeants to ſee them keep their Poſtures: A good time they continu'd this Exerciſe, and then caſt themſelves in a Ring, Dancing in ſuch ſeveral Poſtures, and ſinging and yelling out ſuch helliſh Notes
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:56274:124"/>and Screeches; being ſtrangely Painted, every one his Quiver of Arrows, and at his Back a Club; on his Arm a Fox or an Otters-skin, or ſome ſuch matter for his vambrace; their Heads and Shoulders Painted red, with Oyl and <hi>Pocones</hi> mingled together, which Scarlet-like colour, made an exceeding handſome ſhow; his Bowe in his Hand, and the Skin of a Bird with her Wings abroad dry'd, ty'd on his Head, a piece of Copper, a white Shell, a long Feather, with a ſmall Rattle growing at the Tails of their Snaks ty'd to it, or ſome ſuch like Toy. All this while <hi>Smith</hi> and the King ſtood in the midſt, guarded, as before is ſaid, and after three Dances they all departed. <hi>Smith</hi> they conducted to a long Houſe, where thirty or forty tall Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows did guard him, and e're long, more Bread and Veniſon was brought him than would have ſerv'd twenty Men, I think his Stomack at that time was not ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good; what he left, they put in Baskets and ty'd over his Head. About mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night they ſet the Meat again before him; all this time none of them would eat a bit with him, till the next Morning they brought him as much more, and then did they eat all the old, and reſerv'd the new as they had done the other, which made him think they would feed him for ſlaughter: Yet in this deſperate eſtate to fend him from the cold, one <hi>Maocaſſater</hi> brought him his Gown, in requital of ſome Beads and Toys <hi>Smith</hi> had given him at his firſt arrival in <hi>Virginia.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Two days after a man would have ſlain him (but that the Guard prevented it) for the death of his Son, to whom they conducted him to recover the poor man then breathing his laſt. <hi>Smith</hi> told them, that at <hi>James-Town</hi> he had a Water would do it, if they would let him fetch it, but they would not permit that; but made all the preparations they could to aſſault <hi>James-Town,</hi> craving his advice, and for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence he ſhould have Life, Liberty, Land, and Women. In part of a Table<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>book he writ his mind to them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> at the Fort, what was intended, how they ſhould follow that direction to affright the meſſengers, and without fail ſend him ſuch things as he writ for, and an Inventory with them. The difficulty and danger, he told the Salvages, of the Mines, great Guns, and other Engines, exceedingly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighted them, yet according to his Requeſt they went to <hi>James-Town,</hi> in as bitter weather as could be of Froſt and Snow, and within three days return'd with an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer.</p>
                     <p>But when they came to <hi>James-Town,</hi> ſeeing Men ſally out as he had told them they would, they fled; yet in the night they came again to the ſame place where he had told them they ſhould receive anſwer, and ſuch things as he had promis'd them, which they found accordingly, and with which they return'd with no ſmall expedition, to the wonder of them all, ſuppoſing that he could either Divine, or the Paper could ſpeak: then they led him to the <hi>Youthtanunds,</hi> the <hi>Mattapanients,</hi> the <hi>Payankatanks,</hi> the <hi>Nantaughtacunds,</hi> and <hi>Onawmanients</hi> upon the Rivers of <hi>Rapahanock,</hi> and <hi>Patawomek,</hi> through intricate ways, and back again by divers other ſeveral Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, to the Kings Habitation at <hi>Pamaunkee,</hi> where they entertain'd him with moſt ſtrange and fearful Conjurations. Not long after, early in the Morning, a great fire was made in a long Houſe, and a Mat ſpread on each ſide thereof; on the one they caus'd him to ſit, and all the Guard went out of the Houſe, and preſently there came skipping in a great grim Fellow, all Painted over with Coal, mingled with Oyl; and many Snakes and Weſels skins ſtuff'd with Moſs, and all their Tails ty'd together, ſo as they met on the Crown of his Head in a Taſſel; and round about the Taſſel was a Coronet of Feathers, the Skins hanging round about his Head, Back, and Shoulders, and in a manner cover'd his Face; with a helliſh voice, and a Rattle in his Hand. With moſt ſtrange geſtures and paſſions he began his Invocation, and environ'd the fire with a Circle of Meal; which
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:56274:125"/>done, three more ſuch like Devils came ruſhing in with the like antique Tricks, Painted half black, half red; but all their Eyes were Painted white, and ſome red ſtrokes like <hi>Mutchato's,</hi> along their Cheeks: round about him thoſe Fiends Danc'd a pretty while, and then came in three more as ugly as the reſt, with red Eyes, and white ſtrokes over their black Faces; at laſt they all ſate down right againſt him, three of them on the one hand of the chief Prieſt, and three on the other; then all with their Rattles began a Song, which ended, the chief Prieſt laid down five Wheat Corns, then ſtretching his Arms and Hands with ſuch violence, that he ſweat, and his Veins ſwell'd, he began a ſhort Oration: at the concluſion, they all gave a ſhort groan, and then laid down three Grains more; after that, began their Song again, and then another Oration, ever laying down ſo many Corns as before, till they had twice incircled the Fire; that done, they took a bunch of lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Sticks, prepared for that purpoſe, continuing ſtill their Devotion, and at the end of every Song and Oration, they laid down a Stick between the Diviſions of Corn: rill night, neither he nor they did either eat or drink, and then they fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted merrily, with the beſt Proviſions they could make: Three days they us'd this Ceremony, the meaning whereof they told him, was to know if he intended them well, or no. The Circle of Meal ſignifi'd their Countrey, the Circles of Corn the bounds of the Sea, and the Sticks his Countrey. They imagin'd the World to be flat and round, like a Trencher, and they in the midſt. After this they brought him a Bag of Gun-powder, which they carefully preſerv'd till the next Spring, to Plant as they did their Corn, becauſe they would be acquainted with the nature of that Seed; <hi>Opitchapam,</hi> the King's Brother, invited him to his Houſe, where, with as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Platters of Bread, Fowl, and wild Beaſts, as did environ him, he bid him well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, but not any of them would eat a bit with him, but put up all the remainder in Baskets. At his return to <hi>Opechancanoughs,</hi> all the Kings Women, and their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, flock'd about him for their Parts, as a due by Cuſtom, to be merry with ſuch Fragments.</p>
                     <p>At laſt, they brought him to <hi>Meronocomoco,</hi> where was <hi>Powhatan</hi> their Emperor. Here more than two hundred of thoſe grim Courtiers ſtood wondering at him, as he had been a Monſter; till <hi>Powhatan</hi> and his Train had put themſelves in their greateſt Braveries. Before a Fire, upon a ſeat like a Bedſted, he ſat cover'd with a great Robe, made of <hi>Rarowcun</hi>-Skins, and all the Tails hanging by. On either hand did ſit a young Maid, of ſixteen ox eighteen years of Age, and along on each ſide the Houſe, two rows of Men, and behind them as many Women, with all their Heads and Shoulders Painted red; many of their Heads bedeck'd with the white Doun of Birds, but every one with ſomething, and a great Chain of white Beads about their Necks. At his entrance before the Emperor, all the People gave a great ſhout. The Queen of <hi>Appamatuck</hi> was appointed to bring him Water to waſh his Hands, and another brought him a bunch of Feathers, in ſtead of a Towel to dry them: Having Feaſted him after their barbarous manner as well as they could, a long conſultation was held, but in concluſion, two great Stones being brought before <hi>Powhatan,</hi> as many as could, laid Hands on him, dragg'd him to them, and thereon laid his Head, when being ready with their Clubs, to beat out his Brains, <hi>Pocahontas,</hi> the Emperors deareſt Daughter, ſeeing no intreaty could prevail, got his Head in her Arms, and laid her own upon his to ſave him from death; whereat, the Emperor was contented he ſhould live to make him Hatchets, and her Bells, Beads, and Copper; for they thought him a Man of all Occupations like them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; for the King himſelf will make his own Robes, Shoes, Bowes, Arrows, Pots, Plant, Hunt, or do any thing as well as the reſt.</p>
                     <pb n="205" facs="tcp:56274:125"/>
                     <p>Two days after, <hi>Powhatan</hi> having diſguis'd himſelf in the moſt fearful minner he could, caus'd Captain <hi>Smith</hi> to be brought forth to a great Houſe in the Woods, and there upon a Mat by the Fire to be left alone. Not long after, from behind a Mat that divided the Houſe, was made the moſt doleful noiſe he ever heard; then <hi>Powhatan,</hi> more like a Devil than a Man, with about two hundred more as black as himſelf, came unto him, and told him, That now they were Friends, and preſently he ſhould go to <hi>James-Town,</hi> to ſend him two great Guns and a Grindſtone, for which he would give him the Countrey of <hi>Capahowoſick;</hi> and for ever eſteem him as his Son <hi>Nantaquoud.</hi> So to <hi>James-Town</hi> with twelve Guides <hi>Powhatan</hi> ſent him. That Night they Quarter'd in the Woods, he ſtill expecting (as he had done all this long time of his Impriſonment) every hour to be put to one Death or other, for all their Feaſting: but Almighty God (by his Divine Providence) had molli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fi'd the Hearts of thoſe ſtern <hi>Barbarians</hi> with compaſſion. The next Morning be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they came to the Fort, where <hi>Smith</hi> having us'd the Salvages with what kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs he could, he ſhew'd <hi>Rawhunt, Powhatan</hi>'s truſty Servant, two Demi-Culverins and a Milſtone, to carry to <hi>Powhatan:</hi> they found them ſomewhat too heavy; but when they ſaw him Diſcharge them, they being loaded with Stones, amongſt the Boughs of a great Tree loaded with Iſickles, the Ice and Branches came ſo tumbling down, that the poor Salvages ran away half dead with Fear. But at laſt we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain'd ſome Conference with them, and gave them ſome Toys, and ſent to <hi>Powha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan</hi>'s Women and Children ſuch Preſents, as gave them in general, full content.</p>

                     <hi>CArolina</hi> is that part of <hi>Florida</hi> which lies between twenty nine and thirty ſix Degrees and thirty Minutes of Northern Latitude: It is waſh'd on the Eaſt and South, with the <hi>Atlantick</hi> Ocean; on the Weſt with <hi>Mare Pacifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum,</hi> or the South Sea; and on the North, bounds on <hi>Virginia.</hi> A Countrey wherein Nature ſhews how bountiful ſhe can be without the aſſiſtance of Art, the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants (excepting a little <hi>Maiz</hi> which their old Men and Women Plant) depending meerly on the natural and ſpontaneous Growth of the Soil for their Proviſions, the Woods furniſhing them with ſtore of Fruit and Veniſon, and the Rivers with plenty of ſeveral ſorts of wholſom and ſavory Fiſh.</p>
                  <p>This Maintenance, which without forecaſt or toil they receive from the natural fruitfulneſs of the Countrey, will, if we conſider either the largeneſs of their Growth, or the duration of their Lives, be thought neither ſcanty nor unhealthy, their Stature being of a larger ſize than that of <hi>Engliſh</hi>-men, their Make ſtrong and well proportion'd, a crooked or miſ-ſhapen Perſon being not to be found in the whole Countrey; and (where the chance of War, which they are almoſt continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally engag'd in one againſt another in their little Governments, ſpares any of them) they live to an incredible old age; ſo that when the <hi>Engliſh</hi> came there, they found ſome of their Kings, who ſaw deſcend from them the ſixth Generation.</p>

There are alſo other Trees, as Aſh, Poplar, and Bay, with ſeveral ſorts unknown to us of <hi>Europe;</hi> but thoſe which make it almoſt all one general Forreſt of large Timber-Trees, are Oak, both red and white, and Cedar. There are alſo here and there large Groves of Pine-Trees, ſome a hundred Foot high, which afford a better ſort of Maſt than are to be had either in <hi>Mary-Land</hi> or <hi>Norway.</hi> Theſe larger Trees weaving their luxuriant Branches into a cloſe Shade, ſuffer no Under-wood to grow between them, either by their Droppings, or elſe the Heads of Deer which looſening all the tender Shoots, quite deſtroy it; ſo that a great part of the Countrey is as it were a vaſt Forreſt of fine Walks, free from the heat of the Sun, or the incumbrance of Shrubs and Buſhes, and ſo clear and open, that a Man may eaſily ride a Hunting amongſt the Trees, yielding a Proſpect very pleaſant and ſurpaſſing. On the Skirts of theſe Woods grow leſſer Trees and Shrubs of ſeveral ſorts; amongſt them are ſundry Dying Materials, which how well the Inhabitants know how to make uſe of, appears in the Deer-Skins that the chief of them wear, which are Painted, or rather Dy'd, with ſeveral lively Colours.

The low and Mooriſh Grounds are for the moſt part overgrown with Sedge and Reeds, and ſuch other Traſh, which uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally incumbers rich and uncultivated Lands; thoſe they call <hi>Swamſas,</hi> which with a little Husbandry would prove very good Meadows. There are alſo ſome large and pleaſant <hi>Savanas,</hi> or graſſy Plains.</p>
                  <p>Theſe are a part of the Trees and Plants beſt known to us, that Nature of her ſelf produces, in a Soil which contrives and nouriſhes any thing.

                  <p>Beſides the ſimplicity of the <hi>Indians</hi> Diet, it is very remarkable, that they have a general averſion to thoſe two things which are moſt acceptable to our Palates, and without which few of us either eat or drink with any delight; for in their Meats they cannot endure the leaſt mixture or relliſh of Salt; and for their Drink, they utterly abominate all manner of ſtrong Liquor; to the latter whereof, their large Growth and conſtant Health, is perhaps not a little owing.</p>

The Chancellors, for paſſing of Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and managing the State Matters of the Province. 3. The High-Conſtables, for Military Affairs. 4. The Admirals, for Maritime Affairs. 5. The High-Stewards, for Trade. 6. The Treaſurers, for the publick Stock; and 7. The Chamberlains, for Ceremonies, Faſhions, Marriages, Burials, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Theſe are the ſeven ſupream Courts, to whom lies the ultimate Appeal in all Cauſes belonging to them. Each of theſe Courts conſiſts of one Proprietor, and ſix other Councellors, whereof two are choſen by the Nobility, and two by the People. All the number of theſe eight Courts joyn'd together make the Grand Council, which are in the nature of a Council of State, and are entruſted with the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of Affairs of greateſt concernment. There is alſo in every County a Court, and in every Precinct another; from the Precinct Court there lies an Appeal to the County Court, and from the County Court to the Proprietors Court, to which the Matter in queſtion belongs, and there is the laſt deciſion and determination thereof, without any farther Appeal. And to keep the People from the Charges and vexation of long Suits, to the enriching of Men cunning in Words, care is taken, that no Cauſe ſhall be Try'd more than once in any one Court, and that profeſs'd Pleaders for Money ſhall not be allow'd.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Liberty of Conſcience</hi> is here alſo allow'd in the greateſt latitude, but yet ſo, that neither Atheiſts, or Men of no Religion, are permitted; Atheiſm, Irreligion, and vicious Lives being condemn'd, as diſagreeable to humane Nature, inconſiſtent with Government and Societies, and deſtructive to all that is uſeful to, or becoming of Mankind; as on the other hand, rigorous Impoſing of, and hot Contentions about the Ceremonies and Circumſtances of Religion, is an occaſion of perpetual Strife, Faction and Diviſion, keeps Men from ſedate and temperate Enquiries after Truth, eats out the great Cement of humane Converſation, <hi>Charity,</hi> and cannot be found in any one, who hath but modeſty enough to think himſelf leſs than a <hi>Pope,</hi> and ſhort of <hi>Infallibility.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is alſo to be a Regiſter of all Grants and Conveyances of Land, to prevent even the occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Controverſies and Law-Suits.</p>
                  <p>There are ſeveral other leſs conſiderable Particulars in this Government, all contriv'd and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd for the good and welfare of the People; all which are ſo well put together, and in ſuch equal proportion ballance each other, that ſome judicious Men who have ſeen it, ſay, it is the beſt and faireſt Frame, for the well-being of thoſe who ſhall live under it, of any they have ſeen or read of.</p>

Here the Ships met with ſo ſtrong a Tide, that notwithſtanding they had a freſh Gale of Wind, yet could they not ſtem it; one of the Ships was driven to Sea out of ſight; the other two caſting Anchor, which raking, drove toward the Shore; whither, being beckned by the <hi>Indians,</hi> they immediately went; when no ſooner he Landed, but they ran in great Companies to make themſelves Maſters of the Veſſels, kill'd one <hi>Spaniard,</hi> wounded two more: the Night approaching put an end to the Fight. From hence Sailing to the River <hi>La Cruix</hi> for Wood and Water, they were reſiſted by ſixty Natives, which they put to flight with their Guns, and took one Priſoner; after which they erected a Stone Croſs. The Promontory, by which glides the ſtrong Current, lies in twenty Degrees North-Latitude, and call'd <hi>Cabo de Corrientes,</hi> as the Row of Iſles, before the Main Land <hi>Los Martyres,</hi> becauſe the Cliffs at a diſtance appear like Men ſtanding on Poles.

It is generally a fertile and good Countrey in all reſpects, but eſpecially abounding in Cattel and good Paſtures; it is ſubdivided into ſeven inferior Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces or Countreys, which are 1. <hi>Chiapa.</hi> 2. <hi>Verapaz</hi> 3. <hi>Honduras.</hi> 4. <hi>Nicaragua.</hi> 5. <hi>Veragua.</hi> 6. <hi>Coſta Rica;</hi> and 7. <hi>Guatimala,</hi> ſpecially ſo call'd: all differing in Language and Cuſtoms one from another.</p>
               <p>The Biſhoprick (as it is now call'd) of <hi>Chiapa</hi> is border'd on the Weſt with <hi>New Spain;</hi> on the Eaſt with <hi>Vera Paz;</hi> and on the South with <hi>Mare del Zur.</hi> It is a Countrey much ſhaded with Woods, and thoſe repleniſh'd with many fair and goodly Trees, of divers ſorts, and of the largeſt ſize, as Oaks, Pines, Cedar, Myrtle, and Cypreſs-Trees, beſides others which yield them a good kind of Rozen, precious Gums, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> alſo ſeveral ſorts of Balſom, as white, red, green, and black, not onely pleaſant to the Scent, but an excellent Remedy for all manner of green Wounds: the beſt of it drops out of the cut Bodies of the Trees; and the worſt is preſs'd out of the Wood and Leaves.</p>

               <p>There is a ſort of Cabbage call'd <hi>Ilantas,</hi> which grows to the heighth of a Tree, ſo that Birds make their Neſts in them; they are eaten likewiſe like other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Cabbages.</p>
               <p>There is alſo an Herb with narrow Leaves, which is no ſooner touch'd, but it ſhrinks up to nothing; but at the going away of thoſe which touch it, it obtains its former vigour.</p>

               <p>Amongſt other Beaſts is alſo the <hi>Teuthlacokauhqui,</hi> or <hi>Fortreſs of the Serpents;</hi> it hath a Head like an Adder, thick Belly, glittering Scales, a black Back, ſprinkled with white Croſſes; at its Tail there grows yearly a Bone, with which it makes a noiſe when it ſtirs; its poyſonous Teeth deſtroy thoſe which are bit therewith in twenty four Hours, unleſs the part which is wounded be held in the Earth ſo long till the pain be over. Notwithſtanding the noiſe, terrible aſpect, and geſtures of this Animal, the <hi>Indian</hi> Hunters make nothing to take the ſame by the Tail, and wrap it up in Linnen, and carrying it home make it tame. It is able to live a whole Year without either Meat or Drink; its Head when cut off grows to the bigneſs of a Man's Thigh in ten days time.</p>

It empties it ſelf by the Port of <hi>St. Juan</hi> into the <hi>Atlantick</hi> or North-Sea, but reacheth as far as the South or <hi>Mare del Zur,</hi> at leaſt within a very few Leagues; and from whence ſome <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Captains are ſaid to have made a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, though with much difficulty, into the Lake, and from thence to the North-Sea. It is abundantly well ſtor'd with good Fiſh, but withal much haunted with Crocodiles; and the Countrey about it ſo plentiful in all things, eſpecially Cattel, Cotten-Wool, Sugars, and all kind of Fruits: Amongſt which, the chiefeſt is the <hi>Zeiba,</hi> which is of ſo great a thickneſs, that fifteen Men holding Hand in Hand, can ſcarce encompaſs the ſame. The <hi>Callabaſhes</hi> ripen here in fourteen days time: The Sea along the Coaſt, breeds Whales and other Sea-Monſters, which are often ſeen above Water.</p>

Three Leagues beyond <hi>Leon</hi> appears a high ſpiry Mountain, from whoſe top, both Morning and Evening, riſes a mighty ſmoke, and ſometimes caſts out great ſulphurous Stones over the neighboring Fields, and on a ſudden mighty Flames. A <hi>Dominican</hi> Monk, in hopes to get ſome melted Gold out of its burning Mouth, went up the ſame with four of his Fraternity, and carry'd an Iron Chain and a Kettle, which were no ſooner let down into the hole, but they were immediately melted; yet not ſo diſcourag'd, they reſolv'd to venture a ſecond time with ſtronger Materials, which nevertheleſs had the ſame, or rather worſe event; for the Fire flew out in ſuch a manner, that the <hi>Dominicans</hi> ſadly ſcorch'd, had enough to do to eſcape with Life, ſince which none durſt preſume to approach the ſame.</p>

Then deſiring Peace once more, they gather'd all that were able to bear Arms, and ſwore one to another not to ſtir a Foot; and withal made a Law, That whoſoever did ſhrink ſhould be kill'd immediately: But the Women being inform'd hereof, begg'd that they might rather ſuffer under the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Yoke, than be torn in pieces by their Dogs, or kill'd by their Bullets and Swords, alledging, that they were not able to reſiſt the <hi>Spaniards;</hi> and entreated them, that if they were reſolv'd to go on with their firſt Deſign, they would firſt ſend their Wives and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to the other World, that ſo they might not fall into the hands of the merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and bloody <hi>Chriſtians:</hi> Whereupon moſt Voices judg'd it convenient to make uſe of the Opportunity, and to ſubmit to <hi>Monteio.</hi> But his cruel deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings made ſome to contradict that Determination, for which they paid dearly; for not onely they, but their little Infants, were put to the moſt cruel

Some inſtantly deſerting this miſerable place, fled up into the Countrey, and there built a new <hi>Guatimala</hi> (as above-mention'd) ſur-nam'd <hi>St. Jago,</hi> three Leagues farther towards the Eaſt, in a Valley through which flow two Rivers, between two <hi>Vulcans,</hi> or ſmoaking Mountains, which ſometimes vomit forth terrible Flames, mix'd with dreadful Thunder-claps, Aſhes, and great Stones, inſomuch that the Ground all about it, which is exceeding fruitful, ſeems to move. There are many of theſe <hi>Vulcans</hi> in ſeveral parts of <hi>America,</hi> as namely at <hi>Arequipa</hi> in the Kingdom of <hi>Peru,</hi> at <hi>Puebla de los Angelos,</hi> in the Province of <hi>Tlaſcalla</hi> aboveſaid, a Mountain of ſo great heighth, that they are fain to go little leſs than thirty Leagues turning and wind-before they can reach the top of it, and others in ſeveral other places. They are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally Mountains of great heighth, and running ſharp upwards, but at the top containing ſome quantity of plain and level Ground; in the midſt whereof is a Pit or Hole, out of which abundance of Smoak and fiery Sparkles are vomited almoſt continually, and ſo deep, that they are ſuppos'd for the moſt part to reach to the very bottom of the Mountain. Some of theſe <hi>Vulcans</hi> caſt forth neither Fire not Smoak, yet are clearly ſeen to burn at the bottom with a quick Fire, and which is ſo extreamly hot, that it inſtantly melteth Iron, or any other Metal that is caſt into it, as by experience hath been found: for ſome conceiving that the Matter which maintains theſe Fires within the Bowels of the Earth ſo long together, can be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but melted Gold, have endeavor'd ſeveral times to extract and draw it forth in certain Veſſels of Iron and Braſs, which they have caus'd to be let down into the bottom of the <hi>Vulcan</hi> or Pit, by long Iron Chains made on purpoſe: but, as we ſaid, the extream heat and force of the Fire below always melted them before they could be drawn up again, and by that means hath rendred all ſuch Attempts fruſtrate. In this Town, now call'd <hi>St. Jago,</hi> reſide above ſix hundred <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders,
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:56274:150"/>and more than twenty five thouſand <hi>Indians</hi> which pay Tribute. They have alſo a brave Church and two Cloyſters, one belonging to the <hi>Dominicans,</hi> and another to the Order <hi>La Merced,</hi> and likewiſe a noble Hoſpital. Not far from thence is a place call'd <hi>Yzaleos,</hi> where there are Orchards of <hi>Cacoa</hi> two Leagues in ſquare, each of them producing yearly as much as fifty thouſand Men are able to carry. They reckon the <hi>Cacao</hi> by <hi>Contels,</hi> which is the number of four hundred; by <hi>Xequipiles,</hi> of eight thouſand; and by <hi>Carga's,</hi> of twenty four thouſand. In this County is a Mountain, whoſe top ſmoaking continually conſumes by degrees, and oftentimes covers the neighboring Countrey with Aſhes. The Water which flows from the ſame differs very much, for ſome of it is wholſom and fit to drink; ſome foul and ſtinking, and ſome turns Wood, if laid in the ſame<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to Stone. Here is alſo the Beaſt whoſe Head is highly eſteem'd for the <hi>Bezoar</hi>-Stone, which it car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries in the ſame. Here is likewiſe a little Bear, which in ſtead of a Mouth, hath a long Noſe with a round Hole in it, and a hollow Tongue, with which it ſucks Honey, and diſturbs the Neſts of Piſmires. The Women in this Place make curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Earthen Ware, colour'd either red or black with the Mud of two ſeveral Brooks. The <hi>Indians</hi> call'd the boyling Fountains in this County <hi>Hell,</hi> becauſe they bubble up a Bowes-ſhot high, and make the River <hi>Caliente,</hi> which, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it hath paſs'd half a League through a wide Channel, retains its exceeding heat. Not far from it lies a Stone, which having a Crack in the middle, ſends forth a thick Damp, and againſt bad Weather a thundering noiſe.

                  <p>In the middle of a Lake within this Territory is an Iſland, on which the <hi>Indians</hi> had a Tradition, That a Man no ſooner ſet his Foot but he died immediately: which Opinion of theirs was chang'd when the <hi>Spaniards</hi> went thither in Boat-fulls and return'd ſafe again, with Relation that they had ſeen a large Stone Image, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling a Woman; before which lay the Aſhes and Bones of ſlain People.</p>
                  <p>Round about the Village <hi>Guaymoco</hi> grow great Balſom-Trees, which afford Timber of fifty five Foot long. From this Village leads a Way to the City <hi>Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor,</hi> near which the fore-mention'd River <hi>Guachapa</hi> runs with ſo many windings, that the Traveller is forc'd to croſs the ſame ſeveral times before he can come to the Foot of a Mountain which formerly caſt out terrible Flames; but now the combuſtible Matter being conſum'd, there appears onely a great Hole on the top, with Aſhes in a large compaſs round about it. At the Foot of the ſame are two Pits, one of which ſmoaks continually in ſuch a manner, that it ſtifles all thoſe that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach it; yet the Mountain is well overſpread with Cedars and Pine-Trees.</p>

                  </note>This City, by the <hi>Indians</hi> was formerly call'd <hi>Tenuſtatan,</hi> lies in nineteen Degrees and a half to the Northward of the <hi>Equinoctial-Line,</hi> rais'd out of a brackiſh Lake, full of muddy Water; whoſe circumference along the Mountains is ſeventy Leagues: This Lake ſwarms continually with Boats, which carry the People to and again from one inhabited Iſland to another; four Stone-bridges, no leſs coſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly than artificial, with Arches and Gates in ſeveral places, lead from the City to the Main Continent.</p>
               <p>The freſh Water which they have in the City <hi>Mexico,</hi> is led into the ſame through Pipes that lie in the bottom of the Lake; but none are to enjoy the benefit thereof, before they have paid a certain Sum of Money to the King's Collectors.</p>
               <p>Moreover, the City divided into Iſlands, contains above ſixty thouſand Houſes, which being built on ſeveral Iſles, have large Bridges, which reach from one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; ſome that lie in the middle of the Lake, they approach in little Boats; round about the Lake, eſpecially where the way leads from the Continent into the City, lie ſeveral Suburbs, all inclos'd with Walls; between which ſtand ſtrong Towers, cover'd on the top: To keep off the force of the Water, the <hi>Tenuſtatans</hi> have with great labor and charge, made a Bank through the Lake, half way along the City: But the Lake <hi>Laguna,</hi> from whoſe bottom <hi>Mexico</hi> is rais'd, is divided in two parts, the <hi>Sweet Lake,</hi> which is higher than the <hi>Salt,</hi> falls in to the ſame through Sluces, with Bridges built on the Bank that leads from the City to the main Land: The <hi>Salt-Lake,</hi> which hath brackiſh and bitter Water, ebbs and flows according as the Wind blows; no Fiſh is able to live in the ſame, becauſe the Water which in the ſight of <hi>Mexico</hi> falls into the ſame out of the Mountains, hath a ſulphury Ground: All along the ſhore, much Salt is made, with which the Citizens drive a great Trade: There are continually above a hundred thouſand Boats (by the <hi>Indians</hi> call'd <hi>Acales,</hi> and by the <hi>Spaniards, Canoos</hi>) going off and on from one ſhore to another: The freſh Water Lake, which is bigger than the ſalt, and feeds ſmall Fiſhes, hath above fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

               <p>Beſides three publick Markets, every open place affords all ſorts of Proviſions daily; the <hi>Indians</hi> call the Markets <hi>Tianguyſtly,</hi> and the <hi>Spaniards, Tianguez;</hi> the firſt and chiefeſt ſtands in <hi>Tatelulco,</hi> adorn'd with Galleries on three ſides; in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of this Square, which is accounted the biggeſt in the World, ſtands next to the place of Execution, a ſtately Fountain; the Tents which are every Week pitch'd up here for Trade, amount to above thirty thouſand. The ſecond Market call'd St. <hi>John's,</hi> is in <hi>Mexico,</hi> and ſwarms continually with People. The third is call'd <hi>Hipolito,</hi> from the <hi>Guardian-Saint</hi> of the City, whither every Wedneſday and Thurſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day comes ſuch a multitude of People, that this ſpacious Market is too little for them; for the ſale of every Commodity, a peculiar corner is allotted; but great Packs are left to be diſpos'd of in Boats, which lie near the ſhore.</p>
               <p>At the four corners of the City, at preſent call'd St. <hi>John, St. Maria la Rotonda, St. Pablo,</hi> and <hi>St. Sebaſtian,</hi> are above four thouſand <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Families, and thirty thouſand <hi>Indians,</hi> beſides what inhabit <hi>Tatelulco,</hi> now <hi>St. Jago.</hi>

On the breaking of the Banks, <hi>Mexico</hi> hath often ſuffer'd great damage, wherefore the Vice-Roy <hi>de Valeſco</hi> took ſpecial care to make a vent for the Water through the loweſt Mountains; whereupon the Countrey being Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey'd, the Northern Coaſt near the Village <hi>Gueguenoca,</hi> was found to be the moſt convenient. But about the manner of letting the Water out, the Surveyors could no ways agree; moſt of them were of opinion to dig Channels, into which the Lakes might diſcharge their Waters; others, thought beſt to make a Gutter under Ground, which laſt <hi>Velaſca</hi> put in hand with unhappy ſucceſs, becauſe the Labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers who under-min'd the Ground, were choak'd with the falling in of the Sand,

               <p>
                  <hi>Quantitlan</hi> digg'd alſo a Channel of eight thouſand Fathom long, and made an Arch'd Sewer under Ground of the ſame length, which Sewer hath at every two hundred Fathoms diſtance, Vent-holes, and a hole of ſixty Fathom deep, and by this means, diverting abundance of Water, they dry'd <hi>Mexico</hi> in a ſhort time: When the Banks and Streets began no ſooner to appear, but they fell to work to raiſe the Ground, and to lay Bridges, and alſo to build more Boats.

Of theſe were a great number, and the more, becauſe they never us'd their Lances but once. But on theſe Days, which were Conſecrated to the Idol <hi>Tezcatlipuca,</hi> every one beſides the Prieſts wore a new Rope made of the Hemp <hi>Mangey,</hi> of a Fathom long, and a thick Knot at the end, with which they beat themſelves ſo miſerably on their Backs, as if they intended to have broken them: After which the Prieſts ſtay'd five days in the Temple, in which they us'd the like cruelty, eating ſcarce once in twenty four hours.</p>
               <p>Their Priſoners they us'd after a moſt horrid manner, <hi>viz.</hi> in their Temples ſtood a round Stage of Stone; to the top of which they aſcended by a Square Scaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold,
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:56274:160"/>ſupported by twenty eight Pillars; behind which appear'd thouſands of Mens Heads, and amongſt them the Priſoners that were to be Offer'd ſat ſtark naked, and guarded by ſeveral Armed Men; three Foot from the Steps which led up to the top of the Scaffold, ſtood a pyramidical Stone, (by the <hi>Indians</hi> call'd <hi>Quauxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calli</hi>) and behind it two round Chappels, cover'd on the top like Mitres, each had four Holes in a large Gate, in which ſat a horrid Repreſentation, worſhipp'd by ſix Prieſts call'd <hi>Chackalmua,</hi> whereof one call'd <hi>Papas,</hi> or <hi>Topilzin,</hi> whoſe Office was to pluck out the Hearts of the Priſoners, being in greateſt eſteem, wore a red Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle about his Body, not unlike a long Coat, with broad Fringe, which trail'd af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him upon the Ground, and alſo a Crown of green and yellow Plumes on his Head; his Ears and under Lip were likewiſe adorn'd with Precious Stones: The other five appear'd in like manner with their Hands and Faces painted red, but ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Leathern <hi>Faſcia's</hi> about their Heads, and white Coats ſtitch'd with Black on their Bodies, they might eaſily be diſtinguiſh'd from the <hi>Topilzin;</hi> who on a ſudden ran down the Stairs to the Priſoners, and ſhew'd each of them an Image, (ſaying, <hi>This is your God</hi>) made of <hi>Bledo</hi> Paſte, <hi>Maiz</hi> and Honey, green Beads for Eyes, and Grains of <hi>Maiz</hi> for Teeth: whereupon the Priſoners were led up, and laid with their Backs on the ſharp Stone <hi>Quauxicalli;</hi> then the five Prieſts took hold of their Leggs, Arms and Head, put woodden Collars about the Sufferer's Necks, whilſt the <hi>Topilzin</hi> ſhew'd Reverence to the Idol; which done, with a ſharp Stone he cut open the Breaſts of the Priſoners, who in a deplorable condition lay on the pyra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midical Stone, and pulling their Hearts out of their Bodies, ſhew'd the ſame reek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Sun, and at laſt threw them toward the Idol, and the dead Bodies down the Stairs, where ſome appointed for that purpoſe carried the ſame away; but eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one taking his own Priſoner, and roaſting and boyling him, ſerv'd him up to his Friends as a great Dainty.</p>

                  </note>Concerning the erecting of this City, the <hi>Indians</hi> relate thus: That the ſeventh Family of the <hi>Navatlaca's,</hi> Extracted out of the Countrey <hi>Aztlan,</hi> rang'd up and down not without thouſands of Inconveniences, from one Countrey to another, according to the Information which their Sages had given their Spirit <hi>Viztliputli,</hi> till at laſt ſome of the Prieſts ſtraying from the Army, or rather Multitude, got into a Wilderneſs, full of Brambles and Thorns, and came at length to a Place where was a Spring of clear Water, in which the Fiſhes glitter'd like Silver; where ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king up their repoſe that Night, their Spirit inform'd the oldeſt of them in a Dream, that they ſhould find thereabouts a <hi>Tunal</hi> Tree (whoſe Leaves grow out of one another) under which, on a Stone, lay the Heart of the famous Sorcerer <hi>Copil:</hi> This <hi>Tunal</hi> Tree ſhould be diſcover'd by a Crane on the top of it, which in one Foot ſhould hold a Bird, and in the other a Bough of the Tree, near which they were to build a City: The old Prieſt waking, and relating his Dream, every one endeavor'd to find out the fore-mention'd Tree; at laſt they found it, by diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the top a Crane, with ſpread-out Wings looking up towards the Sun, and holding in his Claws a ſmall Bird, inveſted with curious Feathers: Whereupon they with all ſpeed built a Chappel of Turf and Clods of Earth, and cover'd the ſame with Canes, to keep their Idol from the Weather, reſolving, ſo ſoon as they could, to build him a better Temple.</p>
               <p>The Lake on whoſe Iſles they ſetled, abounded with Fiſh and Fowls, which they exchang'd with the neighboring People for Stone and Mortar for the building of a Temple for <hi>Viztliputzli,</hi> and a new City; to which they made a Cawſey in the Lake <hi>Laguna,</hi> and divided it into four great Wards or Diviſions, and ſubdivided them again into leſſer; over which they plac'd peculiar Idols, and order'd a Crane like that which they had ſeen on the <hi>Tunal</hi> Tree to be their City Arms.

Their Arms were chiefly ſharp pieces of Flint made faſt to a Stick, with which they could at one Blow chop off a Horſes Head. They alſo us'd Pikes, Clubs, and Lances, and ſometimes Slings: For defenſive Armour, they had Helmets and Shields, made of Tygers, Leopards, and Lyons Skins. They always fell upon their Enemies unawares, their Deſign being generally to take Priſoners rather than to kill them; for they reſerv'd them for Offerings to their Idols. <hi>Muteczuma</hi> made ſeveral Commanders over his Armies, giving them a Power one above the other, which were to be diſtinguiſh'd by ſeveral Marks; for the chiefeſt ty'd the Hair on the top of their Heads with a red String, betwixt which ſtuck a brave Plume of Feathers; at the end whereof hung as many Taſſels as they had done noble Exploits.

The Soil, by reaſon of the Climate, would be a little inclining to Drought, but that, beſides the frequent Rains which it hath, it is conſtantly moiſtned with freſh Morning Dews, which make it for the moſt part wonderfully fruitful, almoſt beyond belief, yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for every Puſhel of Wheat that is ſown, threeſcore; and of <hi>Maiz,</hi> two hundred for one; beſides great plenty of Sugar-Canes and <hi>Cochinele;</hi> both which neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the <hi>Spaniards</hi> are ſaid to neglect in ſome ſort, employing themſelves wholly about richer Commodities: for the Countrey affords them good ſtore of Mines of Silver and Braſs, but of Gold or Iron, not many as yet have been found. The Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers abound plentifully with Fiſh, and the Woods with Weniſon, and ſome other wild Beaſts. The Countrey is generally more mountainous than plain, frequently ſhaded with Woods, and whole Forreſts of the ſtatelieſt Pine-Trees and Oaks that are to be ſeen; amongſt which breed abundance of Wolves, which do great miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief to the People, as alſo Scorpions and <hi>Muſtiecho's.</hi> The Hurts receiv'd from Scorpions, are heal'd with the Juice of the Fruit call'd <hi>Queon;</hi> thoſe from the <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiecho's,</hi> by Vinegar and the Juice of Lemmon.

               <p>The firſt, by the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> call'd <hi>Cardon,</hi> hath ſharp Prickles, thick Leaves, full of ſlimy Juice, an odoriferous Flower, oval Fruit, cover'd with an Orange-colour'd Rind, and ſmall Roots: The Fruit within conſiſts of a white juicy, and well taſted Pulp, full of black Seed.</p>
               <p>The ſecond hath a round Body full of Boughs, with Star-like Prickles hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing downwards, the Flower white, and the Fruit very like that of the <hi>Cardon,</hi> onely ſmaller.</p>

               <p>The third is the <hi>Caxabra,</hi> which ſhoots up to a great Tree full of prickly Cods; at the utmoſt end grows a large white Flower; the Fruit, which is as big again as an Egg, is pleaſant and cooling.</p>
               <p>The fourth ſort hath a ſtraight Body full of Prickles, runs leſſer and leſſer to the top; at the end of the ſmall Boughs, each thick Leaf produces another; the Wood, if kindled, burns like a Candle.</p>
               <p>The fifth, nam'd <hi>Cumbeba,</hi> grows out of ſmall Roots, with three or four corner'd thick Leaves, full of Prickles, the Flower ſomewhat leſs than the former, the Fruit oval, hard and red, having a white and juicy Pulp: The Prickles of this <hi>Cumbeba</hi>-Tree are ſo ſharp, and ſtick in ſo deep, that they can ſcarce be pull'd out. This is that ſort of <hi>Tunas</hi> that produces <hi>Cochinele,</hi> which is a Worm that grows under the Leaves, and is cover'd with a Skin, which being neatly taken off and dry'd in the Sun, as formerly mention'd, becomes a rich Commodity. <hi>Joſeph de Acoſta</hi> tells us, that the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Fleet, <hi>Anno</hi> 1578. carried ſo much <hi>Cochinele</hi> to <hi>Spain,</hi> as amounted to two hundred eighty three thouſand ſeven hundred and fifty Ryals.</p>
               <p>But the laſt ſort of the <hi>Tunas</hi> is the <hi>Unirumbeba,</hi> which hath a ſtraight Body full of Prickles, on the top whereof grow divers prickly Leaves, not unlike thoſe of the Palm-Tree: It is onely found in barren places, remote from the Sea.</p>

               <p>The third ſort <hi>Jetiope,</hi> being white, hath a very good relliſh, and cures the Ague.</p>
               <p>The Pepper, which is here call'd <hi>Axi,</hi> grows in the warmeſt Valleys, and the more by being often water'd: there are of it divers kinds, differing in colour, ſmell, and taſte one from the other; for one ſort is green, yellow, or red; another ſort yields a ſtrong musky ſcent; and one ſort is ſharper, another milder: the Veins and Kernels thereof are eaten with Salt.</p>

Both ſorts are reported to faſt eight Moneths together; and though often terribly wounded, and dead to all imagination, yet live a great while after; and though they ſwim up and down in Rivers, yet they Lay their Eggs in the Sand: their Fleſh boyl'd is both wholſom, and of a good reliſh.</p>

Their greateſt Recreation is Dancing, their Muſick being nothing elſe but the noiſe or ſound of a piece of hollow Wood.

Theſe Leaves have a hairy Filament about them, which ſerves in ſtead of Thred: the young Sprout being cut, produces a ſweet Juice, which boyl'd, makes good Wine; when grown ſowre, ſerves for Vinegar; but being twice boyl'd, becomes a Syrrup; and being hung over the Fire a third time, a perfect Honey: Alſo the Wood being ſpungie, keeps Fire as well as Match.

The Inhabitants ſhew'd great Revence to theſe Serpents, becauſe (as they ſaid) the Devil often ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd to them in that form. And this ſeems to be a Cuſtome amongſt them from the Tradition of <hi>Eves</hi> being tempted by the Devil in the ſhape of a Serpent:<note place="margin">Serpents worſhipp'd by the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives.</note> Nor was this Superſtition peculiar onely to theſe <hi>Indians,</hi> foraſmuch as divers Nations of the ancient <hi>Heathens</hi> of other parts of the World, worſhipp'd the Likeneſs of a Serpent.

Several adjacent Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers afford them plenty of Fiſh. They were amaz'd at the Croſſes which the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> there erected, till they were inform'd of a Crucifi'd Saviour. <hi>Espejus</hi> being every where kindly Entertain'd amongſt them, and conducted twenty two Leagues father, came amongſt the <hi>Indians</hi> call'd <hi>Paſſaguates,</hi> of the like Conſtitution with the <hi>Conchi's;</hi> who had skill in Minerals, and judg'd that there were many Silver Mines in that Countrey. From whence the <hi>Paſſaguates</hi> travell'd with the <hi>Spaniards</hi> to the Borders of the <hi>Los Toboſos,</hi> who no ſooner ſaw them, but they fled, becauſe a few years before they had been miſerably dealt with by the <hi>Spaniards;</hi> but being inform'd by the Interpreters, that they needed not be afraid of any thing, they all appear'd, and conducted <hi>Eſpejus</hi> to the Borders of the <hi>Patarabueyes;</hi> which People poſſeſs a large Countrey, Stone Houſes and Villages built in good order. Great Rivers with come out of the North, and others that diſembogu'd into the North Sea, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded them all ſorts of Fiſh; as alſo the Woods plenty of Veniſon, Fowls, and wholſom Plants. In ſome Pools alſo the ſalt Water afforded Salt.</p>
               <p>The Valour of the Inhabitants may ſufficiently appear by the rough Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which the <hi>Spaniards</hi> met withall the firſt Night; for the <hi>Patarabueyes</hi> fell ſo fiercely upon them, that had not the Watch given notice thereof in time, none had eſcap'd with Life; nevertheleſs five Horſes were kill'd, and a conſiderable num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Men wounded: after which retreating, they went upon a neighboring Hill, whither <hi>Espejus</hi> ſent his Interpreter, and an <hi>Indian</hi> the ſame Countrey, to inform them, That the <hi>Spaniards</hi> came not to moleſt them, and if they pleas'd to come to them, they ſhould meet with none but Friends; which was the more eaſily credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, becauſe the <hi>Caſiques</hi> receiv'd ſome Preſents; after which being reconcild, they conducted the <hi>Spaniards</hi> twelve days Journey up a long River, whoſe Banks were inhabited in ſeveral places. from thence they reach'd to a Place, inhabited by a People richly Cloth'd, who alſo ſeem'd to have ſome knowledge of God; for in
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:56274:185"/>their Diſcourſe they pointed up to Heaven, call'd the Creator and Preſerver of all things <hi>Apalito,</hi> and ſignifi'd that they had receiv'd that Knowledge formerly from thoſe that were left of <hi>Pamphilius Narvaez</hi>'s Army, who having rang'd through <hi>Florida</hi> were driven hither.</p>
               <p>Theſe People alſo Preſented <hi>Eſpejus</hi> many tann'd Skins, with which he went to a great Village, the Inhabitants whereof were very courteous, and barter'd them for brave Plumes of Feathers and Cotton Cloaks, ſtreak'd with blue and white: but <hi>Eſpejus</hi> having no Interpreters whom they could underſtand, could not learn by what Name they were known; yet by ſigns they expreſs'd what time of the year they had Precious Stones brought to them; and alſo what their Countrey produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced; and alſo that abundance of thoſe Riches was to be found in a Province about five days Journey Weſtward from thence, whither they freely offer'd to conduct the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> which accordingly they did, bearing them company one and twenty Leagues to the next Province, inhabited by a People whoſe Name alſo they could not be inform'd of, yet ſtaying three days amongſt them, they were Entertain'd with Preſents and Dances both Night and Day. The Countrey afforded them alſo ſtore of Veniſon and Fruits: Thoſe that underſtood Minerals, judg'd that there were likewiſe ſeveral Gold Mines.</p>
               <p>Leaving this Province, they entred into a great Wilderneſs of Pine-Trees, in which they travell'd twelve Leagues in fifteen days, without ſeeing either Man or Houſe; but at the end of the Wood they ſpy'd a Village of Straw Huts, where there were great quantities of white Salt, and Deer Skins neatly dreſs'd. The Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the Place courteouſly Entertain'd the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and conducted them along the River <hi>Del Norte,</hi> to <hi>New Mexico:</hi> The Banks of the River on each ſide was plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with Nut-Trees and Vines, which ſpread themſelves out above three Leagues; through which they had ſcarce paſs'd three days together, when they ſaw ten Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous Villages pleaſantly ſeated on the the ſaid River, from whence came many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of the Natives to meet <hi>Eſpejus,</hi> who was not ſo much amaz'd at the great number of People, as at their extraordinary Civility and decent Habits; for they Entertain'd him with well dreſs'd Meat, roaſted Poultrey, and pleaſant Fruits: Their Garments were Cotton Cloaks, Deer-skin Breeches, Shoes and Boots of good Leather. The Women wore their Hair neatly Comb'd and Pleited. Their Houſes were almoſt four Stories high, handſomely built, and divided into fair Chambers, had Stoves or Cells under Ground againſt the Cold in the Winter. Every Village was Govern'd by a <hi>Caſique,</hi> whoſe Commands were publiſh'd by the <hi>Alguaziles.</hi> Each Houſe had a peculiar place in which their Idol ſtood, before whom they ſet Meat twice a day. Near the High-ways ſtood Temples very curiouſly painted, wherein their Deity, as they ſay, diverted himſelf in his Progreſs from one Village to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. At certain Diſtances near their Plough'd Lands, ſtood <hi>Portico's,</hi> ſupported on four Columns, under which the Husband-man us'd to eat, and take his Noon-ſleep. Beſides their Swords, which were ſtrong enough to cut a Man through the Middle, they us'd Bowes and Arrows: Their Shields were made of Deer Skins.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Eſpejus</hi> having ſtay'd here four days, went to the Province <hi>De las Tiguas,</hi> which had ſixteen Villages; in the chiefeſt whereof, call'd <hi>Poala, Auguſtine Ruyz</hi> and his Brother Monk <hi>Franciſcus de Lopez</hi> had been ſlain, beſides four others; wherefore the People being conſcious of this Crime, and fearing that Revenge would follow, fled to the Mountains, from whence they could not be enticed, whilſt the <hi>Spaniards</hi> found their Houſes full of Proviſions and ſome Minerals.</p>
               <p>Now thoſe being dead whom they ſought for, ſome though it convenient to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn; but <hi>Eſpejus</hi> and <hi>Beltran</hi> perſwaded the contrary, alledging, That farther up,
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:56274:186"/>according to the <hi>Indians</hi> information, lay ſeveral Provinces which were worth the diſcovery, and advis'd that the chiefeſt part of their Forces might ſtay there, whilſt they and ſome few reſolute Men went farther upon the Diſcovery, which accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly was perform'd. <hi>Eſpejus</hi> having travell'd two days, came into a fruitful Province, jutting againſt <hi>Cibola,</hi> in which he found eleven Villages, inhabited by above fourteen thouſand People, who were clad in Skins and Cotton, worſhipp'd many Idols, and receiv'd the <hi>Spaniards</hi> with great Civility.</p>
               <p>The like Entertainment they met withall in the Countrey <hi>Los Quires,</hi> waſh'd by the River <hi>Del Norte;</hi> near which ſtood five Villages, inhabited by about fifteen thouſand People.</p>
               <p>Thirteen Leagues farther they found <hi>De los Cunames,</hi> having alſo five Villages, the chiefeſt of which being <hi>Cia,</hi> boaſted (as above mention'd) eight Market-places: The Houſes, made of Lime, were neatly Painted, and compris'd in all above twenty thouſand Perſons, and civil People, who preſented <hi>Eſpejus</hi> and his Company with handſom Cloaks, ſet good boyl'd Meat before them, and ſhew'd them rich Minerals, and the Mountains out of which they got the ſame.</p>
               <p>Of the like Conſtitution were the Inhabitants <hi>De los Amires,</hi> which being thirty thouſand in number, reſided in ſeven well built Villages, lying North-Weſt from <hi>Cunames.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After this they march'd Weſtward, and found the eminent Village <hi>Acoma,</hi> men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd before, built on an exceeding high Rock, to which led onely a narrow Path up a pair of Stairs cut in the Rock; as alſo many Wells to receive Rain, beſides what they have out of a River, led by moats round about their Plough'd Lands. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> ſtaying here three days, were Entertain'd with all ſorts of good Meat, Dances and Drolls.</p>
               <p>From hence travelling twenty four Leagues more Weſterly, they entred the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of <hi>Zuny;</hi> where the erected Croſſes which had remain'd there till that time, were ſufficient teſtimonies of <hi>Cornaro</hi>'s having been there, after he was deſerted by <hi>Andreas de Cuyocan. Caſper de Mexico,</hi> and <hi>Antonius de Guadalajara,</hi> being ſetled on <hi>Zuny,</hi> (otherwiſe call'd <hi>Cibola</hi>) and ſpeaking the <hi>Indian</hi> Tongue better than their Native Language, inform'd <hi>Eſpejus,</hi> that ſixty days Journey farther lay a great Lake, whoſe Shores were crown'd with many brave Villages, inhabited by a People which wore Golden Armlets and Ear-rings; whither <hi>Franciſcus Vaſquez</hi> had gone a ſecond time, had not Death prevented him. This Information ſo encourag'd <hi>Eſpejus,</hi> that notwithſtanding it was ſo great a Journey, yet he reſolv'd to venture thither, though the Monk <hi>Beltran</hi> and moſt of his Company perſwaded him to the contrary; whereupon <hi>Beltran</hi> return'd: After which <hi>Eſpejus</hi> went on to the ſaid Lake; wither he was accompanied with a hundred and fifty <hi>Indians.</hi> Having gone twenty ſix Leagues, he found a populous Province, whoſe Borders he no ſooner approach'd, but he was told, <hi>That if he was willing to loſe his Life, he and his Party might enter into a forbidden Dominion;</hi> yet notwithſtanding this threatnign Meſſage, he wrought ſo much upon the <hi>Caſique</hi> by the Preſents which he ſent him, that he was permitted to come in freely; nay, the Inhabitants of <hi>Zaguato</hi> ſtrow'd Meal on the Earth for the <hi>Spaniards</hi> to go over, and preſented <hi>Eſpejus</hi> at his departure with forty thouſand Cotton Cloaks, and a conſiderable quantity of Plate, which he ſent with five of his Soldiers, and all the <hi>Cibolan Indians,</hi> back to <hi>Cibola,</hi> keeping onely four Companions and one Guide, with whom he travell'd forty one Leagues Weſtward; where he found a Mountain, to the top whereof led a broad Path; which aſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he took up Silver Oar with his own Hand. The ſeveral ſorts of People that inhabited here were all civil and courteous, living in good faſhion, in pretty large
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:56274:186"/>Houſes, built on the Banks of a pleaſant River, ſhaded with Vines and Nut-Trees, and thick planted with Flax: They inform'd <hi>Eſpejus,</hi> that near a River which runs eight Miles towards the North Sea, were ſuch ſtately Places, as could not be beheld without great admiration. But <hi>Eſpejus</hi> going back a plain Road to <hi>Cibola,</hi> found not onely thoſe whom he had ſent from <hi>Zaguato,</hi> but alſo <hi>Beltran,</hi> with the other Soldiers, who having been detained where by the Civilities and kind Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the <hi>Indians,</hi> were now upon returning home; ſo that <hi>Eſpejus</hi> was left alone with eight Soldiers, who reſolv'd to venture their Lives and Fortunes with him. They travell'd along the River <hi>Del Norte,</hi> through the Provinces <hi>De los Guires</hi> and <hi>Habutas,</hi> whoſe Mountains, over-ſpread with Pine-Trees and Cedars, have many rich Mines. The Natives wore painted Cotton Cloaks, and dwelt in ſtately Houſes five Stories high. At the Borders of the Realm <hi>Los Tamos</hi> they were ſtopt, and not permitted to come on farther; wherefore being but few in number, and ſeveral of them ſick, they judg'd it convenient to croſs the River <hi>De las Vaccas</hi> (ſo call'd from the abundance of Cows that were thereabouts) to the River <hi>Conchos</hi> and the Village <hi>Bartholomew,</hi> where <hi>Eſpejus</hi> was inform'd, that <hi>Beltran</hi> was long before his arrival gone to <hi>Guadiana.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now that we may have the better Account of <hi>New Mexico</hi> (which <hi>Ruyz Eſpejus,</hi> and <hi>Beltran</hi> endeavor'd to diſcover) it will be neceſſary to begin with the firſt original thereof, according as ſeveral ancient. Hiſtories make mention.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Firſt original of the <hi>New Mexicans.</hi>
                  </note>The moſt ancient Poſſeſſors of that part of <hi>Northern America</hi> call'd <hi>New Spain,</hi> were for their fierce and ſalvage Nature call'd <hi>Chichimecae,</hi> who dwelling in Caves, fed on Moles, Rabbets, Hedghogs, Serpents, Roots and Herbs. Whilſt the Women accompanied their Husbands in their Travels, the Children were put into Baskets, and hang'd in a Tree. No manner of Government was to be found amongſt them. They never Till'd their Ground till the <hi>Navatlacans</hi> came from <hi>New Mexico</hi> (which was anciently divided into two Countreys, <hi>Aztlan</hi> and <hi>Teuculhuacan</hi>) to <hi>New Spain;</hi> after which they Sow'd their Lands.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Navatlacans</hi> (who us'd to dwell in Houſes, worſhip Images, plough their Lands, and obey their Governors) were divided into ſix Tribes, each Tribe poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing their limited Bounds: and there goes a Tradition, That out of ſix Pits that are to be ſeen in <hi>New Mexico,</hi> the <hi>Navatlacans</hi> had their original. The time when they deſerted <hi>New Mexico,</hi> as their moſt authentick Hiſtories or Records declare, was (according to our computation) <hi>Anno</hi> 940. and they farther affirm, that they ſpent forty years in a Journey, which might have been travell'd in a Moneth: The reaſon of which tediouſneſs was, becauſe they reſted in all places where they found a fruitful Countrey; but as they had advice from their diabolical Spirits, which (as they ſay) appear'd viſibly to them, they ſtill went on farther and farther, yet left behind thoſe that were aged, ſick, and decrepid, building convenient Houſes for them, and appointing Overſeers to look after them. The Ruins of the Houſes are yet to be ſeen on the Way along which they paſs'd.</p>
               <p>The ſix Tribes divided themſelves after this manner: Four of them ſetled round about the great Lake of <hi>Mexico.</hi> The <hi>Sichumilans</hi> taking the South part, built, beſides two other Towns, a Metropolis of their own Name, as the <hi>Chalcans</hi> on the North. The <hi>Tapunecans</hi> built <hi>Azcapuzalco</hi> in the Weſt, which ſignifies <hi>A Piſmires Hole,</hi> becauſe of the abundance of Inhabitants. The Eaſtern part was taken up by the <hi>Chalhuans.</hi> And all theſe Names have a peculiar ſignification; the firſt ſignifies <hi>People of Flowry Fields;</hi> the ſecond, <hi>People of Mouthes;</hi> the third, <hi>People of Bridges;</hi> and the fourth, <hi>Crooked People.</hi> Not long after, the <hi>Tatluicans,</hi> a ſtrong People, went over the Mountains on the other ſide of the <hi>Mexican</hi> Lake, where they built ſeveral Towns
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:56274:187"/>on a hot, yet fruitful Soil, the chiefeſt whereof they call'd <hi>Quahunachua,</hi> that is, <hi>A Place where an Eagles Voice is heard.</hi> The <hi>Tlaſcaltecans</hi> went near the Snowy Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, one, of which, being between <hi>Mexico</hi> and <hi>De los Angelos,</hi> vomits horrid Flames and Smoke up into the Skie. Here ſcattering up and down, they built ſeveral Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages, beſides the City <hi>Tlaſcalla;</hi> the Inhabitants whereof aſſiſted the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> as hath been related in the taking of <hi>Mexico,</hi> for which good Service they live free, without paying any Tribute.</p>
               <p>When theſe ſix Tribes came firſt from <hi>Mexico</hi> thither, the <hi>Chichimecans</hi> made little or no reſiſtance againſt them, but hid themſelves amongſt the Rocks: yet ſome of them not long after taking courage, flew to Arms, and had without doubt deſtroy'd the <hi>Tlaſcallans,</hi> had not a ſubtile Plot ſav'd them: for under a ſhew of Friendſhip they falling on the unarm'd <hi>Chichimecans,</hi> kill'd every Man of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Joſeph de Acoſta</hi> tells us, that <hi>Anno</hi> 1586. he ſaw a Grave in <hi>Mexico,</hi> wherein a <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chimecan</hi> of a Gygantick ſize lay buried.</p>
               <p>After this Conqueſt gotten by the <hi>Tlaſcallans,</hi> the fore-mention'd ſix Tribes liv'd in Peace and Quiet, and ſtrengthned themſelves the more by Marrying into one anothers Families.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Chichimecae</hi> keeping on the Mountains left the new People in quiet poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of their Lands, nay, learnt ſome of their Cuſtoms, inſomuch that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to build Huts, chuſe Governors, and live according to their Laws.</p>

                  </note>He was a woodden Image like a Man, ſitting on a blue Seat in a triumphant Chair; at each end of which was plac'd a Staff with a Serpents Head upon it, from whoſe Forehead, which was Painted blue, ran a Streak of the ſame colour, croſs his Noſe to both his Ears; upon his Head ſtood a Plume of Feathers, the ends whereof were tipp'd with a golden Varniſh; his left Hand held a white Shield, on which ſtuck five Feathers, and on the top a Laurel Bough; next the Shield lay four Arrows, pretended to be ſent from Heaven; in his right Hand a Truncheon, full of blue crooked Streaks like Serpents; behind on his Shoulders appear'd Wings, not unlike thoſe of a Bat, his Eyes large and round, and his Mouth reaching from Ear to Ear, made him terrible to behold, alſo gaping, and full of Teeth, which ſtuck out of his Belly; in his Breaſt alſo were two fiery Eyes, and under them a ſhrivell'd Noſe; his Feet ended in Claws, hung round about with Precious Jems, golden Boxes and Shields ſet out with divers colour'd Feathers. The Curtain be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind which this Idol ſat, was not drawn open except on a Feaſt-Day.</p>

His Feaſt they kept once in four years.</p>
               <p>This Idol alſo had the Command of Hunger, Drought, Famine, and peſtilen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Diſtempers; wherefore he had quite another ſhape, ſat on a Stool behind a red Curtain embroider'd with dead Mens Bones and Sculls; his Body Coal black, his Head ſtuck full of Quails Feathers, a Quiver with four Arrows in his left, and a Rod in his right Hand, which made the Image ſeem very terrible.</p>

The whole extent of the Province gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally ſo term'd, hath been reputed to comprehend the ſuppos'd <hi>Peninſula</hi> it ſelf, <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bola, Quivira,</hi> and <hi>Nova Albion;</hi> but ſince, according to the beſt Maps and Diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, there ſeems little doubt to be made, that <hi>California,</hi> ſtrictly taken, is a perfect Iſland: and ſince upon that Conſideration we have reſerved it to be deſcrib'd amongſt the Iſlands of <hi>Northern America,</hi> we alſo conſequently judge it moſt requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to conſider thoſe Countreys apart that were included in the extended <hi>California.</hi>

                  <hi>Cibola</hi> lieth Southward of <hi>Quivira,</hi> betwixt it and <hi>New Gallicia,</hi> to the North and Eaſt: on the Weſt it hath <hi>Mar Vermiglio,</hi> or the Bay of <hi>California.</hi> The Air of the Province is indifferently temperate, eſpecially if compar'd to the ſharp Froſts and Colds of <hi>Quivira.</hi> The Countrey is for the moſt part level and plain, as <hi>Quivira</hi> is, having but few Trees in it, except here and there ſome Woods of Cedars, which yet do abundantly ſupply the Natives both with Timber and Fewel. The Ground affords plenty of <hi>Maiz,</hi> and ſome ſmall white Peaſe, of both which they uſually make Bread. There is great ſtore of Veniſon, and a kind of Sheep (as they ſay, and as it ſhould ſeem by their Fleece) as big as ſome little Horſes or Oxen, ſome of their Horns weighing forty or fifty Pound: But perhaps by ſome miſtake of Authors, this Beaſt may be no other than <hi>Taurus Mexicans,</hi> elſewhere deſcrib'd, whoſe Hair is extreamly thick and ſhaggy, and of which they make Cloth as of Wool, as hath been ſaid. There are alſo Lyons, Bears, and Tygers in this Province, in ſuch numbers, that the People of the Countrey are not a little troubled with them, and would gladly deſtroy them if they knew how. The People are generally well Limb'd, tall of Stature, and ſeem to be a little more Ingenious than their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors of <hi>Quivira;</hi> yet they go naked many of them, onely cover'd with Mantles made of Skins, which are many times painted, and that with ſuch Curioſity and Art, as do ſufficiently argue, that neither themſelves nor their Neighbors of <hi>Quivira,</hi> from whom they have them in Traffick, do make them, but that they are the Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe and Commodity of ſome other Nations, perhaps of <hi>Cathay</hi> or <hi>China,</hi> who, by the North-Weſt Seas, do Trade with the Maritime Parts, and People of <hi>Quivira.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This part of the Countrey hath been reaſonably well ſearch'd by the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> but as yet nothing diſcover'd ſo conſiderable, as to perſwade them to ſtay in it.</p>
               <p>That which ſeems moſt obſervable, is the great Lake <hi>Tonteac,</hi> ſituate almoſt in the midſt of the Province; upon which, or near unto it, they found ſeven or eight old Towns of the Natives, ſome whereof contain'd four or five hundred of their Cottages or little Houſes, and were fortifi'd alſo with Ramparts, and other Works of Defence, ſo as the <hi>Spaniards</hi> could not become Maſters of them, but by Force and Storming: In the attempt whereof <hi>Vaſquez Coronado,</hi> their Commander in chief, was twice beaten down with Stones by the Natives; yet at laſt carrying the Place, he found in it good plenty of <hi>Maiz</hi> indeed, which was ſome refreſhment to his Army, but nothing elſe: whereupon having nam'd the Place <hi>Granada,</hi> in memory of the Vice-Roy of <hi>New Spain,</hi> who ſent him upon that Expedition, he departed. In his return homeward he fell upon a certain Countrey, which he nam'd <hi>Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayan,</hi> of which his Companions report great matters; as firſt, of a certain River call'd <hi>Huex,</hi> on the Banks whereof, in the ſpace of twenty Leagues, or thereabouts, there ſtand no leſs than fifteen good Burroughs, well built, and furniſh'd likewiſe with Stoves or Hot-houſes, againſt the Cold, as in other Countreys of <hi>Europe;</hi> as alſo of a very fruitful and pleaſant Valley, which they therefore call'd <hi>Aroba de Cora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zones;</hi> of another great Town and Territory, call'd <hi>Chichilticala;</hi> and laſtly, of the Valley of <hi>Nueſtra Sennora,</hi> or <hi>Our Ladies Dale,</hi> in the South parts of the ſaid Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, all of them deſcrib'd for ſuch rich and delicious Places, that ſome take them for the <hi>Campi Eliſii</hi> of <hi>America,</hi> eſpecially ſeeing the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were never known to viſit them a ſecond time, the Diſcoveries that have been made ſince being onely of the North-Weſt Parts of the Countrey, along the Coaſts of <hi>Mar Vermiglio,</hi> and this no farther than onely to give Name to certain Capes or Promontories which they met with, as namely 1. <hi>Porto de St. Clara,</hi> near to the Mouth of the River which they call <hi>Rio del Nordt.</hi> 2. <hi>Las Playas.</hi> 3. <hi>St. Michael.</hi> 4. <hi>Lago del Oro,</hi> which bordereth on <hi>Quivira;</hi> and laſtly, <hi>El Rey Coronado,</hi> Eaſtward of that.</p>

               <p>Concerning the abundance of <hi>Turkoiſes,</hi> of which <hi>Niza</hi> makes mention, <hi>Cornato</hi> could give no certain account, becauſe a little before his Arrival the <hi>Granadians</hi> had convey'd their Children, which were under fifteen, and the aged People, who were above ſixty years of age, with their chiefeſt Goods, into remote places.

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Situation of <hi>Quivira,</hi> and Deſcription of the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants.</note>
                  <hi>Quivira</hi> takes up the moſt Northern and unknown part of <hi>America</hi> towards the Weſt, reaching as far as the ſuppoſed <hi>Straight</hi> of <hi>Anian</hi> aforeſaid (if there be any ſuch) or elſe joyning to the Continent of <hi>Tartary.</hi> It is likewiſe the leaſt fruitful part of all the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> eſpecially for Corn. Cattel it hath good ſtore, and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturage indifferent good, the Countrey being for the moſt plain and level, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but Paſturage. The Natives are few and ſalvage, living in Hoards or great Companies together, after the manner of the <hi>Tartars,</hi> to whom they are Neighbors, and (as it is not improbably thought) of their Race. The Men Clothe themſelves moſt commonly in that kind of Oxes Hide, elſewhere ſpoken of under the Name of <hi>Taurus Mexicanus.</hi> The Women wear little elſe but their Hair, notwithſtanding the Countrey, eſpecially for one half of the year, is exceſſive cold. Their Cattel, though they are much leſs than the ordinary Kine of <hi>Europe,</hi> are the chief Suſtenance and Employment of the Natives; by Paſturing huge Herds whereof from place to place, the People live, and maintain a Traffick with other Parts. Yet ſome of them inhabit Towns, the chief whereof, as yet diſcover'd, ſeem to be theſe which follow:</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <note place="margin">Towns of chief note.</note>1. <hi>Acus,</hi> or <hi>Acuco,</hi> a ſmall Town, but ſeated in a ſtrong defenſible place, and being a great Staple for Cotton, the Territory about it hath been taken for a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct Province, and by ſome call'd <hi>The Kingdom of Acuco.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Tignes,</hi> a Town ſeated upon the Banks of a River bearing the ſame Name, and inhabited, it ſeems, by a ſtout and reſolute People, and whom the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> coming amongſt them in the Year 1540. had much ado to maſter: for they endur'd a Siege for the ſpace of ſix Weeks; and at laſt finding themſelves ſo ſtrongly begirt by their Enemies, that there was no means to eſcape but by Death, or yielding up themſelves, rather than they would fall alive into their hands, they firſt buried and ſpoil'd all ſuch Treaſure as they had (which were chiefly Saphires, and a few other Gems, that the Countrey afforded) and after that ſetting on fire their Houſhold-ſtuff, they took their Wives and Children with them, and made a deſperate Sally out upon the <hi>Spaniards;</hi> wherein although they were moſt of them ſlain, and trod under the Horſes Feet, or drown'd in paſſing the River, yet was it not without ſome loſs to the <hi>Spaniards</hi> themſelves: nor would thoſe few that were left behind deliver up the Town, till it was fir'd about their Ears, and that they could no longer abide in it. This Town, by all Circumſtances, muſt needs be the ſame with that before mention'd in <hi>Nova Granada,</hi> which makes good what we have ſaid above, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>New Granada</hi> is by ſome confounded with, or at leaſt taken for a part of this Region.</p>

                  <p>When Corn was firſt Sow'n here, it was obſerv'd to grow very fair, the increaſe was great, and the Grain very good; and ſeveral ſorts of Kitchin Plants that have been Set here, have prov'd very well.</p>

                  <p>Almoſt incredible is the benefit of the Fiſh, which the <hi>French, Biſcainers,</hi> and <hi>Portugueſe</hi> fetch yearly from this Coaſt of <hi>New-found Land,</hi> and the <hi>Bank,</hi> which lieth within twenty five Leagues from the South Cape of that Countrey, where the <hi>French</hi> uſe to Fiſh Winter and Summer, uſually making two Voyages every year thither.

                  <p>This Iſland of <hi>Terra Nova</hi> belongs properly and juſtly to the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> having been under the ſole Juriſdiction of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> from the firſt Diſcovery there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, which was by Sir <hi>Sebaſtian Cabot,</hi> Employ'd by King <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh, to find out ſome other part of <hi>America,</hi> than what had been diſcover'd by <hi>Columbus,</hi> as hath been above declar'd in ſeveral places.</p>

                  <p>Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> no leſs careful to preſerve that Plantation, ſent Sir <hi>Humphrey Gilbert,</hi> a <hi>Devonſhire</hi> Knight, to plant a Colony there, the better to ſecure the ſame, and to increaſe Trading there; and accordingly the ſaid Sir <hi>Humphrey</hi> with two good Ships and a Pinnace in her Name, took poſſeſſion of that Countrey, in the Harbour of <hi>St. Johns.</hi> He Sail'd from thence towards <hi>Virginia,</hi> and by reaſon of ſome unhappy direction in his Courſe, the greateſt Ship he had ſtruck upon Shelves on the Coaſt of <hi>Canada,</hi> and was there loſt, with moſt part of the Company in her; and he himſelf, being then in a ſmall Pinnace of twenty Tun, in the company of his Vice-Admiral (Captain <hi>Hays</hi>) returning towards <hi>England,</hi> in a great Storm, was overwhelm'd in the Sea, and ſo periſh'd.</p>

                  <p>And thereby was alſo granted to the ſaid Sir <hi>George Calvert</hi> and his Heirs, all Iſlands and Iſlets, within ten Leagues of the Eaſtern Shore of the ſaid Region to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Eaſt, together with the Fiſhing of all ſorts of Fiſh, ſaving unto the <hi>Engliſh</hi> free liberty of Fiſhing, as well in the Seas as in the Ports and Creeks of the Province aforeſaid, and the Priviledges of ſalting and drying their Fiſh upon the Shores of the ſaid Province, as heretofore they reaſonably us'd and enjoy'd the ſame, ſo as they do no injury or notable loſs or detriment unto the Lord Proprietary, his Heirs and Aſſigns, or to the Inhabitants of the ſaid Province, in the Ports, Creeks, and Shores aforeſaid, and eſpecially in the Woods growing within the ſaid Province.</p>
                  <p>And by the ſaid Patent all Royal Juriſdictions and Prerogatives, both Military and Civil, within the ſaid Province and Iſlands thereunto belonging, were farther granted to the ſaid Sir <hi>George Calvert</hi> and his Heirs, and he and they thereby created the true and abſolute Lords and Proprietaries of the ſaid Province, ſaving the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance due to His Majeſty, His Heirs and Succeſſors, to be held of them in <hi>Capite,</hi> yielding and paying unto them therefore a white Horſe, when, and as often as any of them ſhall come into the ſaid Province, and the fifth part of all Gold and Silver Oar which ſhould be found there.</p>

                  <p>In the thirteenth Year of King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt, of <hi>England,</hi> &amp;c. about the Year of our Lord 1638.

                  <p>The Commodities that are either by Art or Nature produc'd there, are the ſame with thoſe of the remainder of <hi>New-found Land.</hi> The Winter there is extream cold, the Summer very hot, but withal pleaſant; and during that Seaſon there is great plenty of Paſture for Cattel.</p>
                  <p>The Coaſt of this Province is very ſafe, and as well furniſh'd with variety of bold and pleaſant Harbors, as any other part of <hi>New-found Land;</hi> where the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> likewiſe Fiſh for Cod, the leſſer ſort whereof is call'd <hi>Poor-John,</hi> which is there caught in great abundance, eſpecially at <hi>Ferryland,</hi> and in the <hi>Bay of Bulls.</hi> Beſides theſe two there are divers other excellent Harbors on the Eaſtern Shore of <hi>Avalon,</hi> as <hi>Capling Bay, Cape Broyle, Brittus, Iſle of Spears, Barrom Cove, Whitburns Bay,</hi> and <hi>Petit Harbour</hi> above mention'd. On the Weſt are the Bay of <hi>Placentia,</hi> and ſeveral other good Harbors.</p>
                  <p>There are no <hi>Indians</hi> in <hi>Avalon,</hi> and but few <hi>Engliſh,</hi> by reaſon of the exceſſive Cold in Winter, though Sir <hi>David Kirk</hi> and his Lady, and alſo his Family, liv'd in the Lord <hi>Baltemore</hi>'s Houſe at <hi>Ferryland</hi> for the ſpace of ten years and upwards.</p>
                  <p>The Soil ſeems to promiſe great ſtore of Mines, which probably may in time be
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:56274:198"/>diſover'd. The late Lord <hi>Baltemore</hi> took accidentally a piece of Oar up that lay there upon the ſurface of the Earth, and brought it with him into <hi>England,</hi> which was found upon trial to yield a greater proportion of Silver, than the Oar of <hi>Potoſi</hi> in the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> but hitherto no Mine of it hath been diſcover'd there.</p>
                  <p>The Trade of Fiſhing being of ſo great concernment to the Nation of <hi>England,</hi> the ſame (if it be well manag'd in this Iſland of <hi>Terra Nova</hi>) will employ every year above two hundred Sail of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ships, and ten thouſand Mariners, beſides the great benefit which may accrue unto the Nation by Impoſition upon Strangers there, which would amount to ſeveral thouſands of Pounds <hi>per Annum;</hi> with which thoſe Coaſts may be Guarded, and Ships Trading thither ſecur'd: beſides the great Cuſtoms by the Ships call'd <hi>The Sacks</hi> (being commonly in great numbers every year) who carry Fiſh from <hi>New-found Land</hi> into the <hi>Straights, France, Portugal,</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> and who bring their Returns into <hi>England,</hi> as Bullion, and all other native Commodities of thoſe Countreys.</p>
                  <p>If the Iſland were well fortifi'd, we might Command all thoſe of other Nations that come to Fiſh in <hi>New-found Land,</hi> to pay Contribution in Fiſh or otherwiſe, for their Priviledge to Fiſh there, the ſaid Iſland being firſt Planted by <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to the Kingdom of <hi>England;</hi> or if occaſion ſhould require, they might be utterly debarr'd of Fiſhing there.</p>
                  <p>The Trade of Fiſhing is of ſo great concernment to <hi>France, Spain, Portugal,</hi> the <hi>Straights,</hi> and other Parts, that they cannot well be without that yearly Supply in Fiſh which comes from that Iſland: Neither can the <hi>Hollanders, Spaniards,</hi> or <hi>Portugueſe,</hi> well ſet any Ships to the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> without <hi>New-found Land</hi> Fiſh, there being none that will endure to paſs the Line ſound and untainted, but the Fiſh of that Countrey, ſalted and dry'd there. And ſo long as the Act continues ſtill in force, That no Fiſh be Tranſported from the ſaid Iſland, but in <hi>Engliſh</hi> Bottoms, it will contribute very much to our encreaſe of Shipping there, and by conſequence, of the employment of Mariners; and the Fiſhing of that part of the Iſland will be ſolely appropriated to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation, to whom of right it belongs, which will prove the greateſt Ballance of Trade in that part of the World; and that whereas above two hundred Sail do Trade thither yearly to Fiſh, if a thouſand Sail come, if there be but Fiſher-men enow, they may all have Fraughtage there.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>French,</hi> if once the Iſland be fortifi'd, will be depriv'd of their Nurſery of Mariners, this being the onely place, beſides <hi>Canada,</hi> and one or two adjacent Coaſts, where they come for ſupply of Fiſh, with which that Nation cannot be furniſh'd ſo well from other Parts.</p>
                  <p>By well Planting and Fortifying <hi>New-found Land,</hi> the Trading to <hi>Virginia, New England,</hi> and thoſe Parts, would be much encourag'd, <hi>New England</hi> having had of late great Traffick with <hi>New-found Land,</hi> where they vend the Growth of their Plantation. Beſides, <hi>New-found Land</hi> is a Key to the Gulf of <hi>Canada,</hi> which if the <hi>Engliſh</hi> had again in their poſſeſſion, as they had in the Years 1628. and 1632. they might give a Law to all foreign Kings and People intereſted in any of the parts of <hi>America,</hi> and a Protection to all the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Plantations upon that Continent, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by great ſecurity, comfort and profit would ariſe to the Nation and People of it: whereas on the contrary, if the <hi>French, Spaniſh,</hi> or <hi>Dutch,</hi> ſhould poſſeſs themſelves of the ſaid Plantation, they would not onely deprive this Nation of all the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages aforeſaid, but would alſo derive to themſelves ſo great a Power to preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice all the Plantations of the Coaſts of <hi>America</hi> belonging to this Nation, that the Inconveniences thereof are ſcarce to be imagin'd or expreſs'd.</p>

The firſt Expedition of Sir <hi>Francis Drake</hi> hath been already hinted, but for the memorableneſs of that bold Exploit, we ſhall give a particular Account of it from a late Writer, who hath ſet forth the Life of that brave <hi>Engliſh</hi> Heroe. In the Year of our Lord 1580. about the end of <hi>February</hi> ſetting Sail from <hi>St. Chriſtophers</hi> for <hi>Hispaniola,</hi> by the Way they met with a ſmall Frigat bound for <hi>San Domingo,</hi> and the Men of her being Examin'd, one aſſur'd them that the Haven of it was a barr'd Haven, and the Shore well fortifi'd, ſo that there was no convenient Landing within ten <hi>Engliſh</hi> Miles of the City, whither this Man undertook to conduct them. <hi>January</hi> the firſt they Landed ten Miles from the City, and marching thither under the Command of the Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant General, arriv'd about one a Clock in the Afternoon; when they came near, about a hundred and fifty Gentlemen well Mounted, preſented themſelves againſt them; but the ſmall Shot playing upon them, they departed, and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded towards the two Gates of the City that lay towards the Sea, both which the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had Mann'd, and planted their Ordnance without the Gates, and ſome ſmall Shot in an Ambuſh by the Way-ſide: The <hi>Engliſh</hi> being about twelve hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Men, divided themſelves; the Lieutenant-General leading the one half to one Gate, and Captain <hi>Powel</hi> the other half to the other Gate, vowing that with God's aſſiſtance they would not reſt till they met in the Market-place: No ſooner had the <hi>Spaniards</hi> diſcharg'd their Ordnance, doing ſome little Execution, but the Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant-General haſted, or rather ran upon them, to prevent their Charging again, and notwithſtanding their Ambuſh, entred Pell Mell with them into the Gate, not ſtaying till he came into the Market-place, unto whom ſhortly after came Captain <hi>Powel</hi> with his Companies. This Place they ſtrengthned with Barricado's, the City being too large to be guarded by ſo ſmall and weary an Army. And after Mid-night they in the Caſtle, hearing ſome of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> buſie about the Gate, quitted it, ſome being taken Priſoners, and others eſcaping by Boats. The next day the Engliſh enlarg'd their Quarters, and fortifi'd themſelves, and held the Town for a Moneths ſpace. During this time the General ſent a <hi>Negro</hi> Boy with a Flag of Truce to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who by the Way was met by ſome Officers of the Galley which the <hi>Engliſh</hi> had taken, together with the City, who furiouſly thruſt the poor Boy through the Body; who returning to the General, and having declar'd how barbarouſly they had us'd him, fell down and died in his Preſence. The General being much mov'd herewith, commanded the Provoſt-Martial to take two Fryers, and to carry them to the ſame place with a ſufficient Guard, and there to hang them; and withal he ſent one of the Priſoners to inform the <hi>Spaniards</hi> why he did it, and to tell them, that till the Party who had thus murder'd his Meſſenger were deliver'd to him, there ſhould no day paſs wherein he would not hang two Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, till all were conſum'd. Hereupon the day following the Murtherer was brought, and an Offer made to deliver him to the General, who yet thought it more honorable to make them perform the Execution themſelves in the ſight of the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh,</hi> which was done accordingly.</p>

After this the <hi>Spaniards</hi> built all their Houſes of Stone, and a Fort at the Mouth of the Harbor, yet nevertheleſs the City lay open on the Land ſide; of which the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Fleet, Cruiſing about in thoſe Seas, being inform'd, Landed not far from <hi>Havana,</hi> and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd the City before Day-break: the <hi>Spaniards</hi> thus ſuddenly ſurpriz'd, fled into the Woods, whileſt the <hi>Engliſh</hi> plunder'd and ranſack'd the City without any reſiſtance. But this was not the laſt Blow which <hi>Havana</hi> receiv'd, for during the Wars between the Emperor <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth, and the <hi>French</hi> King <hi>Henry</hi> the Second, a Ship ſet Sail with ninety Soldiers from <hi>Diep</hi> to <hi>Cuba,</hi> where they made themſelves Maſters of <hi>St. Jago,</hi> and carried great Treaſure away with them: Thus enrich'd, they ſet in the Night on <hi>Havana,</hi> but found their Expectations fruſtrated, for all the Houſes were empty, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> (being ſo often Plunder'd) having remov'd all their Goods to their Countrey Houſes, which lay ſcattering about the Iſland. Whileſt the <hi>French</hi> were ſearching the Houſes, two <hi>Spaniards</hi> came under pretence of agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with them, but their Deſign was chiefly to take an Account of their Enemies Forces.

                  <p>This large Iſland <hi>Cuba</hi> (as we have before obſerv'd) formerly divided into ſo many populous Territories, is now in a manner deſolate; for according to the <hi>Spaniards</hi> Relation to the Admiral <hi>Henry Jacobſon Lucifer,</hi> when he was before <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vana, Cuba</hi> had upon it not above ſixty thouſand Perſons in all, in <hi>Anno</hi> 1627.

                  <p>The Cotton of this Place is accounted very firm and ſubſtantial, and preferr'd before any that grows in the neighboring Iſlands.</p>
                  <p>Of Tortoiſe-ſhell there is alſo good ſtore, by reaſon that much of that ſort of Tortoiſe is taken on this Coaſt.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Situation and Names of the <hi>Caribbee</hi> Iſlands.</note>THe <hi>Caribbee Iſlands,</hi> as they are generally call'd, are a Row or Ridge, as it were, of leſſer Iſlands, which extend themſelves almoſt in faſhion of a Bowe, from the Coaſt of <hi>Paria</hi> as far as <hi>St. John de Porto Rico;</hi> they are otherwiſe call'd <hi>The Caraibes,</hi> ſometimes <hi>The Camercanes,</hi> and by ſome <hi>The Iſlands of Cannibals,</hi> or <hi>Man-eaters,</hi> (though this Appellation cannot in reality be more appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated to theſe Iſlands, than to many other, either Iſlands, or Parts of the Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent of <hi>America;</hi>) laſtly, whereas all the Iſlands between <hi>Florida</hi> and <hi>New Spain,</hi> and <hi>Southern America,</hi> are by ſome comprehended all under the Name of <hi>The Antilles;</hi> yet the <hi>Caribbees</hi> and the <hi>Antilles</hi> are moſt generally, and, we conceive, moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly accounted the ſame; and they are ſo call'd, either as lying like a Bar before the greater Iſlands, or <hi>Quaſi Ant-Iſles,</hi> i. e. <hi>Oppoſites Iſles;</hi> they lie all under the <hi>Torrid Zone,</hi> between the eleventh and nineteenth Degrees of Northern Latitude, and are twenty eight in number: but before we come to treat of each of them in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, we ſhall take notice of the moſt obſervable of thoſe things which are common to them all in general.</p>
                  <pb n="346" facs="tcp:56274:226"/>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Temperature of the Air.</note>The Air of all theſe Iſlands is of a good temperature and healthy, and the Heat not ſo exceſſive in them at any time of the year, as might be conjectur'd from their Situation under the <hi>Torrid Zone,</hi> by reaſon of a gentle Eaſt Wind, which riſing in the Morning, continues moſt commonly till towards the Evening, allaying the ſcorch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing heat of the Sun, and refreſhing the Air; but the Nights are commonly very cold; and it is obſervable, that by how much the hotter any Day hath been, ſo much the colder the Night following happens to be; whereof this reaſon is given; That the Vapors rais'd in the Day-time by the Sun, and falling down condens'd at Night, do very much cool the Air; but it is never ſo cold as to Freeze.</p>
                  <p>For half a year together Day and Night are equal in theſe Parts, and the reſt of the Year the Day fourteen hours long, and the Night ten.</p>
                  <p>From <hi>April</hi> to <hi>December</hi> there commonly fall here great Rains, and all that Seaſon is accounted Winter, and the Drought and Heat of the other Moneths is taken for Summer; but the Woods of theſe Parts looking ever green, make as it were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual Summer.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Nature of the Soil.</note>The Soil is generally as fertile as in moſt places of <hi>Europe,</hi> and each Iſland fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd with fair Rivers, Brooks, Lakes, Springs, Wells, and other Sources of freſh Water, beſides in many places Mineral Waters, which are us'd with good ſucceſs in the cure of ſeveral Diſeaſes; alſo out of ſome Mountains ſtore of Brimſtone is digg'd, and it is conjectur'd that there are not wanting Mines of Gold and Silver, if they were well look'd after; and there hath been often found Cryſtal upon the Sands by Rivers ſides.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Vines grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing naturally in the <hi>Carib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bees.</hi>
                     </note>The Vine, though wild, and naturally growing in the Woods, yet yields a very large fair Grape; and thoſe which are cultivated in their Gardens or Vineyards, bear excellent Grapes twice a year, but very little Wine is made of them, in regard they find it will keep but very few days.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Wheat not apt to grow there.</note>Wheat in the <hi>Caribbees</hi> grows up no farther than the Blade, and the reaſon is judg'd to be, becauſe through the rankneſs of the Soil, and for want of Winter, this Grain ſprings up faſt, and hath not ſubſtance enough left in the Root to ſupply it up to maturity; but no doubt but Barley, Rye, and thoſe other Grains, to the ripe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of which more Heat is requir'd, would thrive there very well.</p>
                  <p>Beſides Lemmon-Trees, Orange-Trees, Citrons, and Pomegranates, and other Fruit-Trees growing in <hi>Europe,</hi> there are very many ſorts of Trees, Herbs, Pulſe, and other Plants, of a different kind from thoſe amongſt us, and peculiar for the moſt part to theſe Iſlands.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Fruit-Trees.</note>Of Fruit-Trees, the moſt obſervable are the <hi>Goyavier,</hi> ſomewhat reſembling the Laurel, onely having a ſofter Leaf, and of a brighter Green; its Fruit about the bigneſs of a Pearmain, but full of little Kernels like a Pomegranate.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Papayer,</hi> which is of two kinds, one generally growing in all the Iſlands, the other proper to <hi>Santa Crux;</hi> the firſt hath a Leaf not much unlike that of the Fig-Tree, and the other bears a Fruit about the bigneſs of a Melon, which by the <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugueſe</hi> is call'd <hi>Mamao,</hi> from its reſemblance of a Womans Breaſt: the Tree is hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low and ſpungy within, and grows up ſometimes to the heighth of twenty Foot.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Monick,</hi> call'd by the Iſlanders <hi>Corſot,</hi> from the Name of an Iſland from whence the Seeds were firſt brought by the <hi>Dutch,</hi> and bearing a Fruit like a ſmall Cucumber not perfectly ripe.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Junipa,</hi> or <hi>Jenipa,</hi> by the <hi>Portuguese</hi> call'd <hi>Jenipapo;</hi> and by the <hi>Braſilians, Jeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paba;</hi> having Leaves like thoſe of the Walnut-Tree, Flowers like the <hi>Narciſſus,</hi> and a Fruit like a bak'd Apple, which when it falls from the Tree makes a noiſe like the Report of a Gun diſcharg'd, which is ſaid to proceed from the burſting
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:56274:226"/>forth of the Seed out of the thin Skin encloſing it, and breaking with a violence; the Juice, of it Dyes of a Violet-colour, and the Swine and Birds that feed upon it, are ſaid to have their Fleſh and Fat of the ſame colour.</p>
                  <p>A ſort of Vine commonly call'd <hi>The Raiſin-Tree,</hi> and by the <hi>Caribbeeans, Ouliem;</hi> whoſe Fruit being like a large Violet-colour'd Grape, hath in ſtead of the ſeveral ſmall Grain-ſtones which are inclos'd in the Husks of common Grapes, one hard Stone, like that of a Plumb.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Acajou,</hi> bearing for Fruit a kind of Cheſnut, in form of a Hares Kidney, which ſerves for a Creſt to a very fair Apple that by degrees grows under it, of which the Iſlanders make a Drink, very much in eſteem amongſt them, being of an excellent taſte.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Icaco,</hi> a kind of ſmall Plumb-Tree, ſo much coveted, and held for a Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy by ſome People that live near the Gulf of <hi>Hondures,</hi> that they are from thence call'd <hi>Icacos.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Monbain,</hi> which Fruit being a kind of yellowiſh Plumb, is chiefly made uſe of to mix in the Drinks of <hi>Ouicon</hi> and <hi>Maby,</hi> to make them taſte the better.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Courbury</hi> is by ſome reckon'd to be but a ſpecies of the <hi>Monbain,</hi> onely more full of Leaves, and growing higher and bigger; but the Fruit of the <hi>Courbury</hi> is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently different from that of the <hi>Monbain.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Indian</hi> Fig-Tree, differing in Leaf from the common Fig-Tree, but whoſe Fruit both in figure and taſte is not much unlike the Fig growing in theſe Parts: This Tree is commonly of ſuch a vaſt Bulk, that the Branches of ſome of them have been ſeen to afford ſhelter to two hundred Men.</p>
                  <p>A kind of Service-Tree, differing from ours, by its exceeding heighth, fair Leaves, and pleaſant Fruit.</p>
                  <p>The Prickly or Thorny Palm, ſo call'd from its being arm'd all over with Prickles, both Trunk and Leaves; by inciſion into its Branches a ſort of Wine is made, and it is conjectur'd to be the ſame Tree which the <hi>Braſilians</hi> call <hi>Ayry.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Franc</hi>-Palm, an exceeding high and ſtreight Tree, bearing on the top of its Trunk a whitiſh marrowy ſubſtance, by the <hi>French</hi> call'd <hi>Choude Palmiſte,</hi> or <hi>Palm-Cabbage;</hi> for being boyl'd with the thin Leaves that incircle it, and well ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon'd, it is reckon'd amongſt the Delicacies of the <hi>Caribbees.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Latanier,</hi> another kind of <hi>Palm;</hi> and <hi>Cocoa,</hi> which is alſo reckon'd amongſt the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral ſorts of Palms; this laſt is a Fruit-Tree famous all over <hi>America,</hi> and hath been at large deſcrib'd elſewhere.</p>
                  <p>There are alſo many other Trees fit for Dying, Joyners Work, and Building, (beſides the <hi>Acajou</hi> before mention'd, of the ſingle Trunks whereof are made thoſe long Shallops call'd <hi>Pyrages,</hi> which are able to carry fifty Men) as</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Acomas,</hi> of the ſame bulk and heighth with the <hi>Acajon,</hi> and equally eſteem'd by Joyners and Carpenters, and of the Fruit whereof the Woodquiſts grow fat at a certain time of the year.</p>
                  <p>The Roſe-wood, to be rank'd amongſt the chiefeſt of thoſe Trees that are made uſe of by Work-men.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Indian</hi> Wood, a very precious and uſeful Tree for ſeveral ſorts of Materials, and of a very fine ſcent.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Iron-Wood,</hi> ſo call'd from its hardneſs, weight and ſolidity, above all that have hitherto been ſpoken of, and beyond either Cypreſs or Cedar for incorrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Braſile-Wood,</hi> ſo call'd as growing moſt plentifully in <hi>Braſile.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Yellow-Wood,</hi> denominated from its Colour, and much eſteem'd for its uſefulneſs

                  <p>The <hi>Roncon,</hi> by the <hi>Braſilians</hi> call'd <hi>Urnex,</hi> in the Husks, ſucceeding the Flowers whereof, which grow in little Buſhes at the end of the Branches, is enclos'd a moſt rich Vermilion Dye, of a very ſoft and viſcous Matter.</p>
                  <p>Here are alſo many other Trees, either uſeful in Medicine, or other ways ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous, as the <hi>Caſsia</hi>-Tree, of the bigneſs and figure of a Peach-Tree; the long Pipes or Cods whereof, containing the Medicinal Fruit, are well known amongſt us by the Name of <hi>Caſsia-Fiſtula,</hi> and to be had at every Apothecaries.</p>
                  <p>Medicinal Nuts, each Nut containing three or four Stones in ſo many Cells, every one of which is inclos'd within a thin white Pellicle, pleaſant enough to the taſte, and out of which is extracted an Oyl, us'd by the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> in ſeveral both Culina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie and Phyſical occaſions.</p>
                  <p>The Cinamon-Tree, ſo noted for its aromatick Bark; alſo <hi>Sandal-Wood, Guaia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum,</hi> and <hi>Saſſafras.</hi>
                  </p>

                  <p>The arch'd <hi>Indian</hi> Fig-Tree, the Bodies of which Trees have been antiently the ſculking Holes and Retreats of the Inhabitants from their Enemies; the Bark is uſeful for Tanners.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Gourd</hi>-Tree, of the bigneſs and heighth of a great Apple-Tree, and of which are made moſt of the Houſhold Veſſels and Utenſils, which are in common uſe at preſent amongſt the Inhabitants.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Mahot</hi>-Tree, of the Bark of which are made Laces and Points.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Manyoc,</hi> or <hi>Mandioque,</hi> of whoſe Root the <hi>Caſſava</hi> Bread is made, and which growing in ſeveral places of <hi>America,</hi> hath been already taken notice of; as likewiſe the <hi>Banana</hi>-Tree, and that call'd <hi>The Apple-Tree of Paradice,</hi> otherwiſe <hi>Adam's Fig-Tree,</hi> the Fruit being reported to be of a very delicious taſte.</p>
                  <p>Other Trees not known in <hi>Europe,</hi> are the <hi>Mapoſu,</hi> divers kinds of Thorny Wood, the Milky Tree, being of a venomous quality, the <hi>Mancenilier,</hi> and that whoſe Root beaten to Powder, and thrown into Rivers, intoxicates the Fiſh, with ſeveral others of leſs note.</p>

What was further remarkable, is, that this Fiſh
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:56274:228"/>had upon the Head a kind of Crown, riſing above the Skin about two Inches, and made oval-wiſe, the Extremities whereof ended in a Point. Above three hundred Perſons of that Iſland did eat of the Meat of it, and that plentifully, and thought it extreamly delicate; It was interlarded with Fat, and being boyl'd it came up in flakes like freſh God, but it had a much more excellent taſte.</p>
                     <p>Thoſe who had ſeen this rare Fiſh alive, and had with great Levers broken the Back of it, affirm'd, That he had made prodigious Attempts to thruſt them with his Horn, which he turn'd with an inexpreſſible dexterity and nimbleneſs, and that if he had had as much Water under him as would have born him up, he would have been too hard for them all. When the Entrails were taken out, it was found that he liv'd by Prey; for there were within him the Scales of ſeveral kinds of Fiſh.</p>

<pb n="361" facs="tcp:56274:233"/>was finiſh'd. They ſeldom Divorc'd their Wives after they had bore them Children, but otherwiſe the Man would break the Bond of Matrimony when he pleas'd. A young Man that had no Relation might court a Stranger, and if her Parents allow'd of it, the Match was made. One that had behav'd himſelf vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antly againſt the <hi>Arovages</hi> was ſure of ſeveral good Matches, for he was refus'd by none whom he Courted; and the abundance of Wives was the greateſt teſtimony of their Valor. Each Wife had a peculiar Dwelling, ſo to prevent all Diſſentions: So ſoon as one of them was with Child, her Husband Lay not with her till after Delivery. If any Woman committed Adultery, her Husband was permitted to knock out her Brains, or rip open her Belly; which done, he acquainted her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the Deed, who return'd him thanks for the ſame. Murderers were ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther burnt or cut in pieces. Children were born here with little trouble, for the Women were no ſooner Deliver'd, but they carried the Infant to waſh at the next Brook; which done they return'd home to their Houſhold Labor, whileſt the Man on the contrary kept his Bed, and ate nothing but a piece of <hi>Caſſava</hi> Bread, which he hollow'd out in the middle, and left the edges till the Feaſt, which was kept at the Naming of the Child: Moreover, he fed on all manner of Dainties for a whole year after. But this Cuſtom was obſerv'd onely at the Birth of the firſt Son, at which time they ſcratch'd the Father's Shoulder with a ſharp Curry-combe, at which if he flinch'd not, it was accounted a good Omen of the Childs future Valor. At fifteen days old they made Holes in the Childs Ears, Lips, and Noſtrils, through which they put a String for the tying on of what-ever Ornamentals. With the like Ceremonies the Child receiv'd a Name, taken from his Predeceſſors, Trees, Fiſhes, or ſome remarkable Paſſages during the Mothers bearing of the Infant in her Womb, or of the Father's Lying-in: But this Name was chang'd ſo ſoon as they went to War, or kill'd a Commander of the <hi>Arovages,</hi> whoſe Name they exchang'd for their own: After which the Mothers took ſpecial care in bringing them up, and at ſix Moneths the Children were able to run alone: When they attain'd to the age of two years, they cut off their Hair, at a great Feaſt made for that purpoſe; from which time forward they exercis'd them in Shooting with Bowes and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows; to which purpoſe they hung up pieces of Meat for them to ſhoot at, which they muſt either hit down, or Faſt.</p>

He was eaſily kept; for not onely the Bread commonly us'd in that Iſland, but all the Fruits and Roots growing there, were his ordinary Food; and when he had more gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him than he needed, he carefully laid up the remainder under the Leaves wherewith the Houſe was cover'd, and took it when he had need. In a word, I never ſaw a more loving or more amiable Bird; 'twas a Preſent for any Prince, if he could have been brought over the Sea.

                     <p>The Trees which grow on this Iſland, are not onely delightful, but profitable;

                     <p>The <hi>Indians</hi> tie theſe Flies to their Hands and Feet, ſo to have the benefit of their Light in the Night; and anoint their Bodies all over (at certain Solemnities where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Candles are forbidden) with the Juice ſqueez'd out of them, which cauſes them to ſhine like a Flame of Fire: They catch them with a piece of Wood which they move in the Air, whereupon the Flyes going to ſit, are taken with a Hat; but their Light vaniſhes if they are kill'd.</p>

                           <p>This Iſland is divided into eleven Pariſhes, and hath in it fourteen Churches and Chappels, and being ſubdivided into divers Plantations, ſmall and great, hath Sugar-works accordingly, with fair and large Buildings made of Stone and Brick, the which generally are pleaſant Habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, and delightfully ſituated, moſt having pleaſant Proſpects to the Sea and Land.</p>

                           <p>The Growth and Manufacture of this Iſland and parts adjacent, is Sugars of all ſorts, <hi>viz.

The firſt four mention'd Commodities receive prejudice to their Product by abundance of Rains or Droughts not happening in their proper Seaſons: alſo violent Winds lodge the Sugar-Canes, thereby the quantity and goodneſs is leſsned. The chief time for Expectation is from <hi>January</hi> to <hi>September,</hi> when comes in the wet Seaſon, that makes the Roads not Cartable, and uſually puts an end to Making and Tranſportation of them. We have two Crops of Corn in a year, Planted uſually when the Rains firſt come in, in <hi>May</hi> and <hi>November,</hi> which is gather'd in about <hi>October,</hi> and in <hi>March</hi> and <hi>April</hi> following.

The number of Veſſels which come hither to Trade in one year is found upon ſearch to be about two hundred of all ſorts, (ſome years more, ſome leſs) as Ketches, Sloops, Barques, &amp;c. containing in Burthen fifteen thouſand five hundred and five Tun, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as they were here Entred, which is at the leaſt a third part leſs than their true Burthen, by reaſon every Ship pays one pound of Powder <hi>per</hi> Tun, the means ordain'd by this Country for ſtoring the Magazine; the greateſt part of which Ships re-load with Sugars for <hi>England,</hi> and many go for <hi>New-England, Bermudas, Virginia, Tangier,</hi> &amp;c. not always full loaden with this Countreys Growth.

                     <note place="margin">Towns and Places of chief note.</note>The chief Towns and Places which the <hi>Spaniards</hi> inhabit here, are 1. <hi>Panama,</hi>
                     <pb n="396" facs="tcp:56274:256"/>the chief City of the Province, being alſo a Biſhop's See, which is Suffragan to the Arch-biſhop of <hi>Lima,</hi> and the ordinary Reſidence of the Governor and Courts of Juſtice for theſe Parts: It is ſeated likewiſe upon the South Sea, and ſo near, that at High-water the Ships are ſaid to Ride even under the Walls. Through this Town the Wealth both of <hi>Peru</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> paſſeth once every Year; from <hi>Spain</hi> by <hi>Nombre de Dios</hi> and <hi>Porto Bello,</hi> from whence whatſoever Merchandiſe or other Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties come from <hi>Spain,</hi> are Tranſported to <hi>Panama</hi> by Land, and from thence by Sea to all the Parts of <hi>Peru;</hi> and by <hi>Panama</hi> whatſoever comes from <hi>Peru,</hi> is ſent into <hi>Spain:</hi> It hath commonly a ſtrong Garriſon of Soldiers in it, and is doubtleſs a Place otherwiſe well fortifi'd, being of ſo great importance. From the Haven <hi>Pericos</hi> three Ways lead to <hi>Panama,</hi> the firſt along a Bridge over a River, whoſe Banks are great Fortifications to the City, the rather becauſe the River is deep, and next it a Pool over-grown with Weeds. The Way from <hi>Nombre de Dios</hi> plain and without Woods, is waſh'd by the Brook <hi>Levendero.</hi> The third runs along over a Stone Bridge and Champain Grounds, that extend from the Haven <hi>Pericos</hi> to the City. Eaſtward from <hi>Panama</hi> appear ſeven Royal Houſes on a Rock, wherein the Courts of Judicature are kept. Five hundred Rods into the Sea lies an Iſland re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling a Half-Moon, and the Haven wherein the Ships when they unlade caſt Anchor, there being elſe not Water enough for laden Barques, and all lie dry the Tide being out: At the Mouth thereof ſtands a woodden Sconce. The Places <hi>Venta de Cruze, Chagre, Quebrada,</hi> and <hi>Ballano,</hi> are alſo fortifi'd againſt any Invaſion, where elſe an Enemy might eaſily Land: But the ſtricteſt Watch is kept at the River <hi>Chagre,</hi> which Weſtward below <hi>Nombre de Dios</hi> falling into the Northern Ocean, brings the Ships up to <hi>Venta de Cruze,</hi> from whence a Way ſcarce five Leagues long leads to <hi>Panama.</hi> The <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Commodities conſiſting moſt in Meal, Oyl, Biskets, Cloth and Silk, are all brought from <hi>Nombre de Dios</hi> along the ſame Way; or elſe in Winter when they cannot ſtem the Current of the River <hi>Chagre,</hi> then they bring their Goods by Land, not without great danger of being taken by the run-away <hi>Negro's,</hi> who ſet upon them out of the Woods with poyſon'd Darts and Arrows; and as many <hi>Spaniards</hi> as they take, ſo many ſeveral ways they put them to death, becauſe they formerly in the time of their Servitude were us'd with all imaginable Cruelties. The Proviſions ſold here at a reaſonable Rate are <hi>Maiz, Peruan</hi>-Meal, Poultrey, Honey, Cattel, Swine, Oranges, Lemmons, Cabbage, and all manner of Garden Herbs or Plants. Round about the fore-mention'd Royal Houſes lie Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warks, with a ſtrong Caſtle on one ſide. A fair Cathedral denotes the Place to be a Biſhop's See: And the <hi>Franciſcans, Dominicans,</hi> and Monks of the Order <hi>De la Merced,</hi> inhabit ſeveral fair Cloyſters here. Two Leagues Weſtward is the Haven <hi>Pericos,</hi> which being ſecur'd from all Winds by three high Iſles that lie before it, is the chief Harbor in which the <hi>Peruan</hi> Plate-Fleet (conſiſting moſt in ſmall Barques) comes to an Anchor before they touch at <hi>Panama.</hi> The Countrey is for the moſt part Mountainous, and in many places ſends forth ſtinking Damps out of muddy Pools; yet in ſome places are <hi>Savanna</hi> Grounds for Cattel to Graze in. The Air would alſo be more unhealthful, if it were not clear'd by the Winds which blow from the Sea. From <hi>July</hi> to <hi>October</hi> there fall continual Rains, mix'd with terrible claps of Thunder. The Inhabitants often recreate themſelves in Hunting wild Hogs, with Nets made of the Brambles call'd <hi>Nequen</hi> or <hi>Henachen,</hi> and that after a ſtrange manner: for they ſet on fire the Buſhes all about the place where they ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the Game to lie, which to ſhun the Fire runs into their Nets; ſo that the ſame Buſhes are both their ſhelter and deſtruction, as affording Material to make the Nets wherein they are taken. Beſides other Birds the Woods alſo abound with
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:56274:256"/>Pheaſants and Turtle-Doves; and amongſt Beaſts, thoſe that carry their Young about them in a Bag, as alſo wild Cats. The Sea abounds with Fiſh, and produces Crocodiles of a large ſize, by the <hi>Spaniards</hi> call'd <hi>Lagartos.</hi> The Trees are ſeldom without Leaves, but bear little or no Fruit.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Nombre de Dios,</hi> which hath broad Streets, high woodden Houſes, and a fair Church: It extends from Eaſt to Weſt along the Northern Ocean, in the middle of a great Wood on Mooriſh Ground, having a great Fen on the Weſt; being ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate under an unwholſom Climate, it hath occaſion'd the death of many People. The Merchants which dwelt here had alſo Habitations in <hi>Panama,</hi> (the reſt of the Houſes being moſt of them Inns for Strangers) from whence as ſoon as they had gotten an Eſtate they went to <hi>Spain.</hi> The Countrey round about lies under Water in many places. The Oranges, <hi>Caſſada</hi>-Roots, and the like, which grow here, oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion many Diſtempers to thoſe that eat of them. In the Harbor, which hath on each ſide a Ridge of Rocks, on which lies decay'd Forts, the Sea is often-times ſo turbulent, that the Ships are forc'd to Ride at ſix Anchors apiece. Eaſtward from the City a freſh-Water River falls into the Haven, on whoſe Banks ſtand ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Garden-Houſes and Orchards. <hi>Anno</hi> 1595. Sir <hi>Francis Drake</hi> arriving here, found a Mill beyond the City; not far from which on a Hill ſtood a Watch-houſe, of which having made himſelf Maſter, he ſet fire on the Town <hi>Nombre de Dios,</hi> as alſo on all the Veſſels that were in the Harbor. The original of the Name <hi>Nombre de Dios</hi> was on this occaſion, <hi>viz. Diego Niqueſa</hi> ſetting Sail with three Ships out of the Haven <hi>Carthagena</hi> to the Golden Countrey <hi>Veragua,</hi> was ſurpris'd by a violent Storm, in which two Ketches, Commanded by <hi>Lupus de Olano</hi> and <hi>Peter Umbria</hi> were driven out of ſight, whileſt he ſuffer'd ſhipwrack, and getting aſhore, rang'd up and down in a deſolate Countrey, where he found no other Food but Roots, till at laſt he met with <hi>Olano;</hi> when the Famine began to increaſe amongſt them in ſuch a nature, that being ſcarce able to carry their Arms, many of them were kill'd by the Inhabitants with poyſon'd Arrows, inſomuch that of ſeven hundred there remain'd ſcarce ninety: <hi>Niqueſa</hi> ſhipp'd as many of them in a new Veſſel which they had made as it could poſſibly carry, and promis'd to fetch the reſt off from <hi>Veragua</hi> as ſoon as he had diſcover'd a Place fit to be inhabited: The firſt Place he Landed at was <hi>Puerto Bello;</hi> from whence being neceſſitated by the <hi>Indians</hi> who gather'd toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to Retreat Aboard, not without the loſs of ſeveral Men, he ſet Sail to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>montory <hi>Mormor,</hi> beyond which he Anchor'd in a ſecure Haven; where, as he was going aſhore he call'd to his Men, ſaying, <hi>Saltiamo in tierra al Nombre de Dios,</hi> that is, <hi>Let us Land in the Name of God,</hi> and caſting up a Fort againſt the Aſſaults of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, call'd it <hi>Nombre de Dios.</hi>

This Epiſcopal Metropolis is on the North waſh'd by the North Sea over a plain ſhallow Ground; on the Land ſide the Sea flows through a narrow Bay by the City towards the Lake <hi>Canupote,</hi> which ebbs and flows equal with the Ocean, and receives and diſcharges its Water through two Pipes which lie under along Bridge,<note place="margin">The Deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption of <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thagena.</hi>

When they attain'd to fourteen Years of Age, ſome were choſen out from the reſt, and oblig'd to perpetual Virginity and ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of Life in their Chappels; which ſacred Obligation if they broke by ſuffering any to Lie with them, they were buried alive after the manner of the Veſtal Virgins, the Ceremony whereof is related by <hi>Plutarch:</hi> Others were oblig'd to make daily Offerings; others to make peculiar Sacrifices for the <hi>Inga</hi>'s Health, and happy Events in War; many alſo were employ'd in the Court-Service to wait upon the <hi>Inga's</hi> Wife or Concubines; and thoſe being abſolv'd from their Vow, were oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times Married to Courtiers.

But their uſual Offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings were <hi>Cuces,</hi> a ſort of Toads, which were eaten by the <hi>Peruvians.</hi> When they were to do any Buſineſs of conſequence, then Perſons of Quality kill'd their Sheep <hi>Pacos,</hi> not without ſtrange obſervation of the colour and number of them, as alſo of the time; all which things well conſider'd, they took the Sheep and laid it croſs their right Arm, turn'd the Face thereof towards the Sun, and mutter'd ſeveral words to themſelves according to the colour; for if it was ſpotted grey, they ſpoke to <hi>Chuquilla,</hi> or Thunder; if white and ſhort Fleec'd, to the Sun; if well Fleec'd, to <hi>Viracocha.</hi> In <hi>Cuſco</hi> they Offer'd daily a ſhort-fleec'd Sheep to the Sun in this manner: Making a great Fire call'd <hi>Vibbacaronca,</hi> the Prieſts threw the Sheep and four Baskets of <hi>Cocoa</hi> into it. Their Sacrifices <hi>Cozocovicca</hi> and <hi>Sapovicca,</hi> to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Conqueſts, were alſo very ſtrange: for they gather'd out of <hi>Puna</hi> (which is a deſolate place) ſeveral ſorts of Brambles and Buſhes nam'd <hi>Ganilli,</hi> which being all ſet on fire, they went about the Fire with round Stones in their Hands, on which were painted Serpents, Lyons, Toads, and Tygers, crying, <hi>Uſachum, grant us Conqueſt,</hi> together with this Prayer, <hi>Deſtroy, O Creator, the power of our Enemies Gods;</hi> which ſaid, ſeveral ſtarv'd Sheep were brought out, which for that reaſon they call'd <hi>Urca;</hi> whoſe Hearts having torn out they began their Prayers afreſh, ſaying, <hi>Mighty</hi> Viracocha, <hi>thus do thou pull out the Hearts of our Enemies.</hi> For the proſperity of the <hi>Ingas</hi> they kill'd in an open Field black Dogs, by them call'd <hi>Appurucos,</hi> whoſe Fleſh was eaten with many Ceremonies by People appointed for that purpoſe. They made Offerings alſo to the Fountains, Rivers, Brooks, and Sea-ſhells, under pretence that thoſe Shells were Daughters of the Ocean, and the Ocean the Father of Streams and Springs; when they had Sow'n their Fields, their Prieſts, choſe to that Office, went from Houſe to Houſe to gather ſuch Offerings as every one was pleas'd to give; which they laid at the Banks of ſeveral Sluces, at the time when the Water began to riſe there, thinking by that Oblation to keep them from over-flowing their Lands, and waſhing away their Seed. In all places where two Rivers joyn'd together they waſh'd themſelves, having firſt bedaub'd themſelves all over with ſtamp'd <hi>Maiz;</hi> and afterwards look'd upon themſelves as well purg'd from Sin; which power they aſcrib'd to their Baths. To ſtrangle Children between four and ten years of Age was never us'd, unleſs upon the <hi>Inga</hi>'s being ſick, or when he receiv'd the Royal Taſſel, that from the death of the Children he might receive Health, or Reign proſperouſly. The fore-mention'd Nuns that were choſe to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend on the King's, were alſo ſtrangled when the <hi>Inga</hi> was ſick; nay, ſometimes a Father would Offer his Son to <hi>Viracocha,</hi> on the Sun-Prieſt's ſuggeſtion, That by his Son's death he would recover from his Sickneſs, Praying to the foremention'd Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that they would be pleas'd to ſave the ſick Father, becauſe the Son had with his Death paid for his Fathers.</p>
               <p>This kind of Cruelty the Devil ſeem'd to prompt the <hi>Heathens</hi> to, by making uſe of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Example, who prepar'd his Son <hi>Iſaac</hi> for a Sacrifice on Mount <hi>Moria;</hi> and that it was a Practice amongſt the antient <hi>Ammonites</hi> and <hi>Moabites,</hi> and other <hi>Heathens</hi> (by which even the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were apt to be ſeduc'd) appears from the Scripture it ſelf: the Ceremonies of which bruitiſh Cuſtoms, with the ſeven Brazen Chambers of <hi>Moloch,</hi> may be ſeen deſcrib'd by <hi>Rabbi Solomon.</hi>

                  <p>In the Valley <hi>Motupe</hi> grow abundance of Trees, which receive nouriſhment from a River that ſprings up near the ſame. Here is alſo much Cotton.</p>

                  <p>The Valley <hi>Collique,</hi> water'd by a River of the ſame Denomination, and very thick ſet with Trees, was formerly very populous, but ſince the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Wars it is become quite deſolate; for not onely a conſiderable number of them were ſlain by the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> but alſo many deſtroy'd themſelves, Wives and Children; of which <hi>Peter Martyr,</hi> Councellor to the Emperor <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth, ſets down ſeveral terrible Examples, of which two were remarkable above the reſt; the firſt was after this manner:</p>

                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Two tragical Paſſages.</note>The ſecond Accident is alſo very terrible, <hi>viz.</hi> An <hi>Indian</hi> Maid being Got with Child by a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Aſs driver, acquainted her Father and Mother with it, withal

                  <p>But to proceed in our Deſcription, next to <hi>Collique</hi> lies the Valley <hi>Zana,</hi> of the like bigneſs, and famous for the City <hi>Miraflores.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The next is <hi>Paſcayamo,</hi> which exceeds all the former in fruitfulneſs, and popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſneſs of Inhabitants, who before they were deſtroy'd by the <hi>Ingas</hi> were much fear'd by their Neighbors. This Valley alſo was adorn'd with ſeveral fair Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, which are now turn'd into Cloyſters. Cattel, Hogs, and Goats breed here in very great numbers. The chief Trade of this Place conſiſts in Cotton and Linnen.</p>
                  <p>The Valley <hi>Chacama,</hi> in which the <hi>Dominican</hi> Monks inhabit a brave Cloyſter, produces abundance of Sugar.</p>
                  <p>Four Leagues farther lies the ſpacious Valley <hi>Chimo,</hi> ſo call'd from an old <hi>Peru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vian</hi> Heroe, which affords a pleaſant Proſpect, by reaſon of the many Banquetting-houſes built there by the <hi>Ingas.</hi> No place in <hi>Peru</hi> is able to ſtand in competition with this for plenty of Proviſions, the Ocean and Rivers producing ſtore of Fiſh, the Countrey affording Cattel and all manner of Fruit. The Cotton which grows here is Shipp'd to the South Sea.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Chanca</hi> is a Valley chiefly conſiderable for the Town <hi>Arnedo,</hi> which is ſituate therein, of which more hereafter.</p>
                  <p>But the Valley <hi>Guanape,</hi> not far from <hi>Chanca,</hi> yields the beſt <hi>Peruvian</hi> Liquor <hi>Chica,</hi> and hath a convenient Harbor for Ships.</p>
                  <p>The Plain <hi>Santa</hi> being overflow'd in the Winter, is all overgrown for want of Inhabitants, who were all deſtroy'd by the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> The Woods hereabouts ſwarm with a ſort of venomous Bug, which exceedingly torments the Traveller.</p>

                     <hi>Joris Spilbergen</hi> Landing here <hi>Anno</hi> 1615. found the Haven ſecure againſt all Winds, and between the Shore and the Village <hi>Guarmey</hi> a Creek, and ſomewhat farther a freſh-Water Pool; on one ſide of which ſtood a decay'd Caſtle built of ſquare Stone, whereon the <hi>Hollanders</hi> ſet the <hi>States</hi> Flag, and Garriſon'd the ſame to ſecure thoſe that fetch'd Water out of the fore-mention'd Pool. In the aforeſaid Village ſtood a Church with a ſpiry Steeple; behind which roſe high Mountains, and at the Foot thereof a great Wood, into which the Inhabitants fled with all their Goods, ſo that <hi>Spilbergen</hi> found nothing but a little Meal, a few Hens, Hogs, and Oranges in their Houſes, which whileſt he was ſending Aboard, a ſmall Body of Horſe appear'd, but immediately fled into the Woods. The <hi>Hollanders</hi> ſtaying here ſeven days, were inform'd, that the Galley <hi>Jeſu Maria,</hi> Commanded by the Admiral <hi>Rodrigo Mendoza,</hi> and the <hi>Santa Anna,</hi> by the Vice-Admiral <hi>Peter Alvares Piger,</hi> were both loſt, not one Man being ſav'd.</p>

                  <p>Not far from hence lie the Valleys <hi>Gaura</hi> and <hi>Lima;</hi> which laſt exceeds all others in bigneſs, and was formerly exceeding populous; but ſince the Marqueſs <hi>Pizarro</hi> built the City <hi>Los Reyos</hi> here, the Citizens have taken the Lands from the <hi>Peruvians.</hi> The Mines hereabouts produce Gold and Silver. Amongſt other things time Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants highly eſteem an Herb bearing yellow Flowers, which in a ſhort time cures a putrifi'd Wound, whereas if laid on ſound Fleſh it eats the ſame to the Bone. The Natives heretofore us'd to ſpend their time in Hunting,<note place="margin">Strange man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</note> and caught their Game after this manner, <hi>viz.</hi> three or four thouſand of them would meet together, and by taking Hands make a Ring of three or four Miles in circumference, and at a certain Note or Tune Sung, or loudly Exclaim'd, they drew nearer and nearer, till at laſt they were within Shot of the incloſed Game, whatſoever it were.</p>
                  <p>The Countrey of <hi>Collao</hi> hath a low Point, from which a long Cliff runs into the Sea, towards the ſmall Iſland call'd <hi>Iſla de Collao:</hi> On each ſide of the Point the Coaſt runs ſloaping in, the one ſide extending North-Weſt from <hi>Collao,</hi> to the Cliffs <hi>Piſcadores;</hi> the other South-Eaſt to the ſecond Promontory; behind which is a large Bay, where the Valley <hi>Pachacama</hi> appears, famous for its exceeding fruitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and a ſtately Temple built by the <hi>Ingas,</hi>

                     </note> where <hi>Ferdinando Pizarro</hi> found above nine hundred thouſand <hi>Ducats,</hi> beſides what the Soldiers and Commanders took, and what the Prieſts had hid, which none, though miſerably tortur'd, would confeſs.</p>
                  <p>Oppoſite to <hi>Pachacama</hi> lies the Valley <hi>Chilca,</hi> where it never Rains, nor any Brook or Spring moiſtens the dry Soil, which nevertheleſs produces <hi>Maiz</hi> and Fruit-Trees. The Natives us'd to dig large and deep Pits, in which they Sow'd and
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:56274:291"/>Planted, and at every Root laid the Head of a Fiſh call'd a <hi>Sardin,</hi> which they caught in Nets on the Sea-ſhore; wherein nevertheleſs nothing would have grown, but for the Morning Dews which fell. The <hi>Ingas</hi> alſo had curious Banquetting-houſes here. In theſe Parts there grows a ſort Tree call'd <hi>Mala,</hi> of which <hi>Acoſta</hi> relates a ſtrange Wonder of Nature, very remarkable, <hi>viz.</hi> That it flouriſhes and bears Fruit on that ſide which beholds the South, in that Seaſon when it is Summer on the Mountains; the other which views the Sea; Bloſſoming and bearing Fruit when it is Summer on the Plains.</p>
                  <p>The Valley <hi>Guarco,</hi> ſpacious and full of Trees, produces eſpecially the pleaſant Fruit <hi>Guayaves</hi> and <hi>Guavas,</hi> as alſo the beſt Wheat in <hi>Peru;</hi> wherefore it is vended all over the Countrey. Here are alſo the Ruines of another ſtately Caſtle, built by the <hi>Ingas,</hi> the former luſtre whereof is teſtifi'd by its remaining Walls, which conſiſt of exceeding great Stones, ſo neatly joyn'd together without Mortar, that it appears like one entire Stone; and by the decay'd Structures of ſeveral Halls, much of the curious Painting whereof is yet to be ſoch, from the Caſtle a large pair of Stairs led down to the Sea-ſhore. Two Leagues farther the River <hi>Lunagun</hi> runs through the fertile Valley of the ſame Denomination. The fatneſs of this Soil is chiefly aſcrib'd to the Dung of a Fowl call'd <hi>Guana,</hi> which the Natives fetch in great abundance from the Iſles near the Main.</p>
                  <p>Next follows the Valley <hi>Chinca,</hi> one of the biggeſt in all <hi>Peru,</hi> and before the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> Arrival very populous. In the time of the <hi>Ingas</hi> it alſo ſhew'd a magnificent Temple Dedicated to the Sun, built by <hi>Tepaja Jupangue;</hi> yet the Inhabitants ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main'd conſtant in the worſhipping of their old Idol <hi>Cinciapema.</hi> Hither the <hi>Ingas</hi> ſent their conquer'd Princes, who on a certain time were to appear in <hi>Cuſco.</hi> The <hi>Dominicans</hi> at preſent poſſeſs here a neat Cloyſter, from whence leads a plain Road to the Dale <hi>Ica,</hi> water'd by the River <hi>Piſco,</hi> which is dry in Summer; wherefore the Natives brought a Ditch from the Mountains, which ſince the <hi>Spaniards</hi> deſtroying the Inhabitants, is choak'd up with Sand.</p>
                  <p>Next the Valley <hi>Naſca</hi> comes in view, famous for the Caſtle <hi>Caxamalca,</hi> where the <hi>Ingas</hi> kept all manner of Ammunition for War, beſides ſeveral Tombs, out of which the <hi>Spaniards</hi> took great Riches. This Valley is divided into ſeveral others, which for the moſt part produce Sugar-Canes; and through them all runs the Royal High-way, which is Wall'd in on both ſides.</p>
                  <p>Beyond <hi>Naſca</hi> lie one behind another the Valleys <hi>Hacari, Oconna, Camana,</hi> and <hi>Quilca,</hi> all of them affording good Paſture for Cattel, and Fruit, yet are moſt of them deſolate.</p>
                  <p>The County <hi>Los Motilonos,</hi> thinly inhabited for want of Proviſions, and divided by two Rivers, ſeparates <hi>Moyobamba</hi> from the Countrey <hi>Charaſmal.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Southward beyond <hi>Caxamalca</hi> appear the Countreys <hi>Guamachuco,</hi> and a little far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Conchucos</hi> and <hi>Piſcobamba,</hi> all fruitful and pleaſant, and adorn'd with ſeveral Structures built by the <hi>Ingas.</hi>

                  <p>The Territory <hi>Pincos,</hi> water'd by a River, and famous for one of the ſtatelieſt of the <hi>Peruvian</hi> Structures, is ſurrounded by the Countreys <hi>Guayalcas, Turama, Bomba,</hi> and <hi>Conchucos.</hi> The Mountains, though dangerous to Travellers by Lyons, great Bears, and other ravenous Beaſts, afford abundance of Silver; and the fruitful Soil produces Wheat, <hi>Maiz,</hi> Grapes, Figs, Oranges, Quinces, Cittrons, Cedars; and likewiſe feeds Goats, Horſes, and other Cattel.</p>

This River is of great conſequence, for it not onely waters the whole Valley of <hi>Lima</hi> with its ſeveral Branches, but alſo runs under every Houſe in the City, being

Moſt of the Houſes built in the high Streets have pleaſant Turrets, which face the Market-place, where all ſorts of Proviſions are brought to Sale, as Oxen, Sheep, Veniſon, Sugar, Oranges, Cittrons, Grapes, and Wheat, which is ground in Water-Mills built near the River. This City is inhabited by many able Merchants, which often load Ships to <hi>Panama,</hi> that are valu'd at above two hundred thouſand <hi>Ducats.</hi> To the Arch-biſhop's See of this Place belongs the Biſhopricks of <hi>Chili, Charcas, Quito, Cuſco, Truxillo, Guanuco, Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paian, San Franciſco, Panama, Nicaragua,</hi> and <hi>Rio de la Plata.</hi> The City is alſo adorn'd with two fair Churches, beſides the Cathedral, and alſo other leſſer Churches, four ſtately Cloyſters, two Nunneries, and the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> Palace, which is very magnificent. The Haven two Leagues diſtant from it, and call'd <hi>Callao de Lima,</hi> is large and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure for Ships. <hi>Anno</hi> 1579.

                  <p>The next Countreys in order towards the South are <hi>Tarana,</hi> abounding with Wheat, and the eminent Valley <hi>Xauxa,</hi> ſurrounded with ſnowy Mountains.

                  <p>The Mines of <hi>Potoſi</hi> exceed all other, becauſe the Diggers never meet with any Water, notwithſtanding they work above two hundred Fathom under Ground, whereas the other Silver Mines ſuffer great damage by the Water; which was alſo the reaſon why the <hi>Spaniards</hi> left off digging of Silver in <hi>Porco,</hi> becauſe they were not onely forc'd to cut through hard Rocks, but ran greater danger, or at leaſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow'd extraordinary labor to get out the Water which broke in upon them.</p>

Afterwards travelling to <hi>Moyabamba,</hi> he got a great eſteem amongſt thoſe Idolaters, and (as it goes for currant amongſt them) wrought many Miracles, amongſt which this is reported for one: He being inform'd by an old <hi>Peruvian,</hi> that his Daughter nam'd <hi>Curi</hi> had hid ſeveral Idols; enquiring after it, he tax'd her with what her Father had told him; which ſhe denying, and being rebuk'd by <hi>Ramirez,</hi> is ſaid to have become immediately dumb, to have foam'd at the Mouth, at laſt falling down dead like a ſecond <hi>Saphira</hi> in the preſence of many, which caus'd many to forſake their Idolatry. But the Necromancers endeavor'd by all means poſſible to raiſe a diſeſteem on <hi>Ramirez,</hi> and with the aſſiſtance of their Maſter the Devil, ſo wrought their Inchantments, that the Tygers came in great Herds out of the Wilderneſſes to <hi>Moyabamba,</hi> and devour'd not onely Men, Women and Children in the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways, but alſo tore them out of their Houſes, yet did not the leaſt hurt to any <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard;</hi> whereupon <hi>Ramirez</hi> valiantly went with a Company of his Proſelytes to a Herd of Tygers, which when he approached held the Croſs to them, which it ſeems ſo affrighted the Devil-Tygers, that they climb'd up the Trees. They farther relate (if you will believe them) to make the Miracle the greater, That <hi>Ramirez</hi> call'd to the Multitude, ſaying, <hi>Go and revenge the Deaths of your devour'd Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, Children and Relations;</hi> whereupon he throwing a Stone, and all the reſt fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing his Example, the Tygers leap'd out of the Trees, ſtood ſtill, and ſuffer'd themſelves to be kill'd like Lambs.

                  </note>FOllowing the Coaſt of <hi>Mare del Zur,</hi> or the South Sea, the next great Province pertaining formerly to the Kingdom of <hi>Peru,</hi> is that of <hi>Chile.</hi> This is the moſt Southerly Province of the whole Countrey of <hi>America,</hi> reaching up as far as the <hi>Magellane</hi> Straights, with which to the Southward it is bounded; North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward it hath a Deſart, and an undiſcover'd Countrey lying betwixt it and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines of <hi>Peru,</hi> call'd <hi>Atacama;</hi> on the Weſt it hath <hi>Mare del Zur;</hi> and on the Eaſt, up to <hi>Rio de la Plata,</hi> the <hi>Atlantick,</hi> or North Sea, with ſome Countreys undiſcover'd, which interpoſe betwixt it and <hi>Paraguay</hi> to the North-Eaſt: It lieth all of it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the <hi>Tropick</hi> of <hi>Capricorn,</hi> in a temperate <hi>Zone,</hi> and extendeth it ſelf in length from the Borders of <hi>Peru,</hi> to the Mouth of the <hi>Straights</hi> five hundred Leagues or more; but the breadth of it neither equal nor certain: They ſay 'tis call'd <hi>Chile</hi> from the word <hi>Chil,</hi> which ſignifies <hi>Cold</hi> it ſeems in their Language as well as ours, it being generally a cold and bleak Countrey, the Air in many parts of it ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly ſharp and piercing, that both Horſe and Rider ſometimes in travelling are frozen to death, as the <hi>Spaniards</hi> found by experience in their firſt Search and Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of the Countrey, under the Conduct of <hi>Diego Almagro,</hi> who is ſaid to have left the greateſt part of his Men dead behind him: But this is chiefly towards the <hi>Andes,</hi> and on the Sea-Coaſt, the more Inland parts of it, though mountainous alſo in ſome parts, yet are more temperate, and being alſo well water'd with Rivers, are much more fruitfull than the other, affording both Wheat and <hi>Maiz,</hi> and likewiſe other Grain, excellent Paſturage in many places, and great ſtore of Cattel, Wine, Honey, and not without many and rich Mines both of Gold and Silver.</p>
               <p>The Natives of this Countrey were found to be the moſt ſtout and warlike of all the <hi>Americans</hi> that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had hitherto met withal, fighting with them, and oftentimes defeating them in the open Field, ſurprizing and ſacking their Towns, and laſt of all taking their Captain and Commander in Chief Priſoner: This was <hi>Pedro Baldivia,</hi> one of thoſe good Men that conſented to the death of <hi>Atta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baliba,</hi> the laſt King of <hi>Peru,</hi> after a greater Ranſom accepted and paid, then per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps the King of <hi>Spain</hi> could well raiſe on a ſudden, if he had occaſion to uſe it for himſelf.<note place="margin">

               <p>The <hi>United Netherlands</hi> alſo ſent Colonies thither with good ſucceſs, for they took ſeveral vaſt Countreys from the <hi>Portugueſe,</hi> by force of Arms, and built new Forts and Towns in ſeveral places. But we will firſt give you a general Deſcription of it,<note place="margin">Temperature of Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate.</note> that ſo we may the better render a Relation in particular of every Province thereof, it being a conſiderable part of the <hi>New World,</hi> and both pleaſant and fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and the Sea-Coaſts refreſh'd by Eaſterly Winds, which begin before Day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>break, when the North Sea ebbs or flows, for then the Wind riſes with the Sun, and continues till Mid-night: Towards the Weſt, where the Mountains divide <hi>Braſile</hi> from <hi>Peru,</hi> it is made temperate by Weſterly Winds, which though judg'd unwhol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom, becauſe they ſeem to ariſe out of the Mooriſh Grounds, yet they hurt not the Inhabitants along that Coaſt, becauſe they either break againſt the high Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, or are driven by the ſtrong Wind which blows from the Sea.</p>
               <p>The difference between Summer and Winter, ſhorter and longer Days, in the main part of <hi>Braſile,</hi> is ſcarce diſcernable, warm Weather laſting all the year round; and for the length of the Day and Night, the Sun being hid under the Horizon twelve hours, ſhines for the moſt part juſt as long, the greateſt difference never being above an hour. Three hours before Day-break the Dew makes it exceeding cold till Sun-riſing; wherefore the <hi>Braſilians</hi> make Fires in the Night near their Hammocks, not onely to keep wild Beaſts from them, but alſo againſt the Cold. After the coldeſt Nights follow the faireſt Days, and the contrary after ſultry Nights; nevertheleſs (except in the rainy Seaſon, which begins with <hi>March</hi> and ends about <hi>Auguſt</hi>) the Skye is generally clear, yet it Lightens much towards the Evening. Rainbowes often appear in the Skye, and bout the Mooon <hi>Halos.</hi> The Rain generally falls in great Drops, and with a mighty noiſe; before which it is generally very ſultry hot, or elſe ſoon after. The Dew, which is fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuller than in <hi>Europe,</hi> is ſaltiſh, which makes it oft to rot things that lie in the open Air. During the rainy Moneths, a South-Eaſt Winds blows from a cloudy Skye, much ſtronger than the Northern in Summer, The South-Eaſt Wind drives the Stream to the North, as the North Wind drives it to the South: And more than this, there is little to be diſcern'd of the Seas ebbing and flowing hereabouts: At the higheſt Tides the <hi>Braſilians</hi> go ſeveral Leagues from the Shore to Fiſh, upon Planks made of the ſpungy Wood call'd <hi>Jangada</hi> faſtned together. The Sea, which ſeems to burn in the Night, is ſo clear in the Day, that the Fiſh may be ſeen to ſwim above twenty Fathom deep. A calm Ocean when the Days and Nights are of an exact length, and eſpecially when dark Clouds appear, is a certain ſign of a dreadful Storm. At Full or New-Moon the Sea riſes twelve Foot, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues either a longer or ſhorter time, according as it is more or leſs turbulent, and the Rivers fall ſtronger or more gently into the ſame.</p>
               <p>Before moſt part of the Coaſt of <hi>Braſile</hi> lies a Stone Cliff of above twenty or thirty Paces broad, which is never cover'd with Water, though in the time of Spring-floods. In this Cliff Nature in ſeveral places hath made a Gap, through which the Ships ſail near the Shore, and ride ſafe at an Anchor.</p>
               <p>The whole Countrey of <hi>Braſile</hi> is divided into thirteen <hi>Praefectures,</hi> or Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips, and hath about as many Rivers, which more or leſs empty themſelves into every one of theſe Countreys. The Eaſtern part hath ſeveral Brooks and Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, which afford good Water both for Man and Beaſt. In ſome parts the Water is ſo ſtrong, that the wild Beaſts making themſelves Drunk therewith, are eaſily taken. During the Winter Seaſon the Rivers glide with great force, and ſwell on a
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:56274:320"/>ſudden, overflowing all the neighboring Countrey, onely the River <hi>San Franciſco</hi> runs ſtrongeſt and riſes higheſt in the Summer Seaſon, whenas in the Winter it flows low, and poures but little Water into the Ocean. The original of this Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver is as yet unknown, yet is by moſt believ'd to come out of a great Lake lying near the <hi>Peruvian</hi> Mountains: The <hi>Hollanders,</hi> who ſail'd forty Leagues up the ſame, found it every where broad and deep, and ſcatter'd full of Iſles and Rocks. The <hi>Portugueſe</hi> ſailing ten Leagues farther, diſcover'd the great Rocks <hi>Cocoeras,</hi> from which the ſaid River falls down with great violence, and extends it ſelf North-Weſt. In the other <hi>Braſilian</hi> Streams, though wide at the Mouthes, which generally are not above two or three hours walking from their Fountains or Springs, no Barque is able to Row up, they being exceeding ſhallow, although much Rain falls into them; the reaſon whereof is becauſe the barren Mountains lying be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Braſile</hi> and <hi>Peru,</hi> diſcharge abundance of Water through the Rivers of <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zones, Maranon, Franciſco, La Plata,</hi> and the <hi>Juaeiro,</hi> with ſuch force into the Ocean, that they keep their ſweetneſs for thirty Leagues. Near the Sea ſide are ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Lakes and Pits which are drinkable, and others up in the Countrey that are brackiſh.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The Nature of the Soil.</note>The Countrey differs exceedingly, for where it extends in Plains the Soil is fat and clayie, and produces all ſorts of Fruit, but eſpecially Sugar-Canes. During the rainy Seaſons the Trees flouriſh moſt; after which the heat of the Sun, and fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tility of the Soil ſpeedily ripen the Fruit: wherefore they Dung not their Land, but on the contrary endeavor to make it lean with Sand, that the Plants might not have too many Leaves, and wither before the Fruit can be ripened. They Sowe in the beginning of the rainy Moneths, and eſpecially take care that the Seed lie not too deep in the Ground, becauſe then the Sun-beams being not able to come at it, ſuffer it to periſh in the cold Ground.</p>
               <p>The high <hi>Cocoa</hi> and <hi>Palmito</hi>-Trees, are tranſplanted all the year round, the Roots being onely cover'd with a little Earth, becauſe they can endure no cold.</p>
               <p>Several Trees here bear a cooling Fruit, as if kind Nature took care to provide againſt exceſſive heat.</p>
               <p>All manner of Plants and Herbs brought hither from <hi>Angola, Portugal,</hi> the <hi>Nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands,</hi> and the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> grow here very plentifully. But the Countrey generally would be much better, if ſome way could be found out to deſtroy the innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble company of Piſmires, which though three times bigger than the <hi>European,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble them very much, and cover the Paths in Woods and Fields for three or four Miles together; and raiſing Hillocks, make them hollow, and fill them with Corn: in the Full of the Moon they gather an incredible quantity of Grain, which they bite at each end, becauſe it ſhould not ſprout: againſt the rainy Moneths they ſtop up their Holes,<note place="margin">Deſcription of the <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manda.</hi>
                  </note> that the Water may not damnifie their Store. But theſe Animals have a mortal Enemy of the <hi>Tamanda,</hi> of which there are two ſorts, the bigger call'd <hi>Guaca,</hi> the leſſer <hi>Miri;</hi> the <hi>Guaca,</hi> notwithſtanding it is no bigger than an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Dog, yet it deſtroys Tygers, and other wild Beaſts, with ſuch a raging fury, that it never lets go what once it hath got hold of, but holds it faſt ſo long till ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it dies of Hunger. The <hi>Guaca</hi> differing from the <hi>Miri</hi> onely in bigneſs, hath a broad Tail full of grey and black Briſtles, which ſticks up when he is vex'd, but when he goes to ſleep, covers himſelf with the ſame. The <hi>Miri</hi> winds his long ſmooth Tail about the Boughs, by which hanging he ſearches the Holes in the Trees with his Tongue, which being thin and round, hath a Gutter in the middle, in which when it feels any Piſmires, it ſuddenly ſwallows them down: If he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives them to have their Neſts under Ground, then he ſcratches up the Earth, and
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:56274:320"/>puts his Tongue in at the Holes. Both the <hi>Guacu</hi> and <hi>Miri</hi> have a thick Skin, and a broad black Streak from their Breaſts on each ſide up half way their Bodies, and through the black runs alſo a white Streak. No Beaſt in the World is hardier than this, for though it faſts twelve days, and is afterwards flay'd alive, yet it will live ſeveral hours after.</p>
               <p>The Lakes in <hi>Braſile</hi> are for the moſt part overgrown with Weeds juſt like a Field, yet are exceeding full of Fiſh and Fowl. Where the Sea runs into the Lakes, great multitudes of Crabs are ſeen crawling along the Ground, and the Oyſters hang in Cluſters on the Boughs of a Plant call'd <hi>Manyle</hi> or <hi>Mangues,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Plant <hi>Manyle.</hi>
                  </note> which grow with their Roots either near or in the Water, in ſuch a manner, that new Bodies ſtill ſhoot from the old Roots, which prevents eaſie acceſs to the chief Plant, on whoſe uppermoſt Leaves after Sun-riſing ſticks very white Salt, which in the Night, or in a cloudy Day turns to a brackiſh Dew. Moreover, thoſe places where <hi>Braſile</hi> riſes with Hills and Mountains, are likewiſe very fruitful, except the barren tops of ſome, which ſeem to kiſs the Skyes; and though the fruitful Mountains flouriſh in the time of the rainy Months, yet many of the Trees which grow on them die in Summer, and their Aſhes being burnt by the Inhabitants, are us'd in ſtead of Dung. Some Woods extend themſelves three hundred Leagues in length, and are full of Trees, ſo tall, that an Arrow ſhot upwards falls ſhort of the top of them, and a Boat may be made out of the Body, which can carry a hundred and fifty Men. On the great Boughs of theſe mighty Trees grow other excreſcent Shrubs after the manner of Miſſeltoe, which proceed from the Kernels ſwallow'd and muted upon them by the Birds that light there. In ſome places alſo grow alſo Sweet-wood Trees, which afford either excellent Gums or Wood to Dye with; amongſt which the chief is the <hi>Ibiripitanga,</hi> which yields the <hi>Braſile</hi> Wood, that gives Denomination of <hi>Braſile</hi> to this vaſt Tract of Land.<note place="margin">Deſcription of the Tree <hi>Ibripitanga.</hi>
                  </note> The Tree <hi>Ibripitanga</hi> is tall and ſpreading, hath ſad colour'd Bark full of ſhort Thorns; the Leaves are green, and differ in form but little from the Box-Tree Leaf; the Boughs ſhoot forth other leſſer, full of yellow and ſweet-ſmelling Flowers, which falling off are ſucceeded by a flat long Cod, of a dark grey colour, full of little red Pulſe; the upper part of the Tree is not good to Dye with, but onely the lower part of the Body, which becauſe the Tree grows far up in the Countrey, is not tranſport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able without much trouble. But the <hi>Tatai-iba</hi> grows in the Woods along the Shore;<note place="margin">The Tree <hi>Tatai-iba.</hi>
                  </note> the Bark being of an Aſh-colour, inveſts a yellow Wood; the Leaves are ſharp and notch'd, the Fruit not unlike Mulberries, pale, juicy, and full of white Seed; the Wood boyl'd Dyes a pure Yellow. It is obſervable not onely of this Tree, but generally of the Trees of this Countrey, that they neither flouriſh, nor ſhed their Leaves all over at once, nor do ſeveral Trees of the ſame kind, and growing here germinate or fade together; for whileſt one is fulleſt of Bloſſoms, the other is without Leaves; and whileſt the ſame Tree ſheds its Leaves on one ſide, the other ſide is newly Budded.</p>
               <p>The <hi>European</hi> Plants and Herbs with ſoft Roots, being once Planted in <hi>Braſile,</hi> come to be hard and lignifi'd. There is alſo great difference, according to the Ground in which they are Planted; for ſuch Plants and Trees as in the Plains are but ſmall and tender, grow ten times higher if Planted in the Woods.</p>
               <p>All ſorts of <hi>Indian</hi> Pulſe grow higher than the talleſt Trees, like high Arbors, under which both Men and Beaſts may ſhelter themſelves from the Sun or Rain.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>Far up into the Countrey amongſt the Mountains, inhabit <hi>Canibals,</hi> or Man-eaters. The <hi>Europeans</hi> that firſt travell'd that way, found the Countrey very fertile and full of People, eſpecially in the Valleys, but ſomewhat incommoded by the want of Water, and the exceſſiveneſs of the Heat in the Day, and of the Cold in the Night. In ſome places the Countrey is ſo over-grown with Brambles, that they are forc'd to cut their way through the ſame. But there are a ſort of Thiſtles, which having concave Leaves, receive the Dew and Rain for the accommodation of the Natives.</p>
               <p>Beſides Serpents and Dragons, the Tygers are moſt of all to be fear'd when hungry, but once ſatisfi'd are eaſily taken.</p>

                  <note place="margin">The Nature of the <hi>Braſili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</hi>
                  </note>The <hi>Braſilians</hi> live to be very old without being Bald or Grey: There are ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom or never to be ſeen ſquint-ey'd, lame, decrepid, or any deformed People, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the Children are never Swath'd but thrown into cold Water as ſoon as born. The Men generally have a very near reſemblance one with another, as alſo the Women, ſo that there is not ſuch a difference betwixt Man and Man there, as amongſt other People. There is ſcarce any Sickneſs heard of in theſe Parts; for beſides a long Life, they enjoy the benefit of Health ſo long as they live. They trouble not themſelves with much Buſineſs; and in one Hut, whoſe Covering con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts of Palm-Leaves, dwell ſeveral Families together.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Their manner of Living.</note>The general Bread of the <hi>Braſilians</hi> is the ſtamp'd Root <hi>Mandihoka;</hi> beſides which they alſo eat all manner of Fruit and Plants, and many times Fleſh, which they either eat boyl'd, broyl'd, or ſtew'd; their Boyling is after this manner: Firſt they kindle their Fire with two Sticks, the one of hard, and the other of ſoft Wood; the hard they make ſharp at the end, and fix the ſame into the ſoft, which ſetting on fire they immediately lay Cotton thereupon, or elſe dry Leaves, and ſo boyl the Fleſh in round Earthen Pots call'd <hi>Camu:</hi> but they account that better which is
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:56274:321"/>ſtew'd in a Pot, the bottom whereof is cover'd with Leaves, on which they lay the Fleſh, then ſtopping the ſame cloſe on the top with Earth and Leaves, they make Fire over it ſo long till they think the Fleſh to be ſufficiently ſtew'd. Their Broyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they perform by fixing forked Stick into the Ground, over which they lay ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral others like a Gridiron, and upon them the raw Fleſh, cut in long Slices, and Pepper'd and Salted, then make a Fire under the ſame till it is enough; and their Meat ſo dreſs'd keeps good fourteen days. Their Fiſh either boyl'd or broyl'd is eaten with the Sawce <hi>Juquitinga.</hi> The little Fiſh <hi>Piaba</hi> and <hi>Piquitinga</hi> they make up in Rolls, and lay them under hot Aſhes. Both with their Fleſh and Fiſh they eat for Bread, as hath been ſaid, the Meal of the Root <hi>Mandihoka,</hi> which they taking up with three Fingers throw into their Mouthes ſo dexterouſly, that not the leaſt ſcrap falls beſides. They never obſerve any ſet hours to eat, for they make ſeveral Meals in the Day and ſometimes in the middle of the Night, if their Appetite ſerves, and neither drink nor ſpeak whileſt they are at their Meat. They ſleep in ſpread Hammocks made faſt between two Poles, near which burns a conſtant Fire with which in the Day-time they dreſs their Meat, and at Night keep themſelves warm, the Nights being there ſomewhat cold, becauſe of their equal length with the Days. Their uſual Liquor is cold Water, taken out of the Fountains, Rivers, or Brooks;<note place="margin">Their ſeveral ſorts of Drinks.</note> but to Carouſe they make the Drink <hi>Caoi,</hi> of the Fruit of the <hi>Ocaiiba</hi>-Tree, which being ſtamp'd in a woodden Mortar, is ſtrain'd, and at firſt looks like Milk, but after a few days ſtanding turns to a darker colour, and is ſtrong enough to make Aſtronomers of thoſe that drink largely of it, but if long kept, it turns to be excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Vinegar.</p>
               <p>They have another Drink call'd <hi>Aipu,</hi> which is made two ſeveral ways; the firſt is thus: An old Toothleſs Woman chews the little cut Root <hi>Aipimacaxera</hi> to a a Pap call'd <hi>Caracu,</hi> which ſpitting in a Pot they pour Water on the ſame, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards boyling it leiſurely, ſtirring it all the time it ſtands over the Fire. The other way of making this <hi>Aipu,</hi> which is much the more cleanly, is to boyl the ſaid Root ſo long, till it comes to be like Butter-milk, and then letting it ſtand till it hath done working, it will be no unpleaſant Drink.</p>
               <p>Another ſort of Drink amongſt them is their <hi>Pacobi,</hi> made of the Fruit of the Tree <hi>Pacobebe</hi> and <hi>Pacobucu;</hi> beſides others made of the Tree <hi>Abatu,</hi> of <hi>Indian</hi> Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley and <hi>Maiz.</hi> Alſo their Liquor call'd <hi>Jetici</hi> is preſs'd out of <hi>Potato</hi>-Roots.</p>
               <p>In like manner the Plant <hi>Nana,</hi> by the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> call'd <hi>Ananas,</hi> makes the Drink <hi>Nanai,</hi> which is exceeding ſtrong and heady, but good againſt Faintneſs, Vomit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Gravel, and ſtoppage of Urine, as alſo againſt Poyſon.</p>

They forbear not to take Tobacco even in the midſt of their religious Ceremonies, which are perform'd with Singing and Dancing in this manner:</p>

Before they march they waſh their Bodies in the River; rub them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves all over with Sand, and afterwards waſh it off again, then ſtretch them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves till all their Joynts crack, run to the Fire, and when throughly warm, ſcratch their Bodies with certain Fiſh-Teeth, inſomuch that the Blood guſhes out of ſeveral places, all which they judge to be good againſt weariſomneſs. About a Stones-caſt from the King's Tent lie two thick Logs, a large Stride one from the other, againſt which the whole Multitude ſtand divided into two Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, each of whom chuſe the ſtrongeſt Man accounted amongſt them to carry the Log for a Wager, and when theſe two are tir'd, they are releas'd by others, and he that comes laſt to the appointed place with the Log, is laugh'd at by the Party to which he belong'd that was there firſt, where they all ſtay for the Youths that bring their Arms, which when they have deliver'd, they all fall to work, cutting down Trees, breaking off the Boughs, ſticking them in the Ground, and tying them together on the top for Tents, which are built in rows one againſt another, leaving a broad Path between. Mean while the Women and Children coming with their Baggage, the Men run to Fiſh and Hunt, or to ſeek Honey. The old Women dig up Roots, which ſtamp'd ſerve them for Bread, whileſt the young Women help one another to prepare the Meat in the Huts. Moreover the Men ſpend their time in ſeveral Exerciſes, as Wreſtling and Running, of which two Women, appointed for that purpoſe, are the Judges. When the Evening draws on upon them, then the Youths dividing themſelves into Companies, go Singing from one Tent to another, and are follow'd by the Maids Dancing and Leaping, every one ſtanding behind him whom ſhe loves beſt; and this is look'd upon as a ſingular ſign of affection. When a young Man is inclin'd to Marry, he carries Honey and Veniſon to his Miſtreſſes Father, who if he hath more than one Daughter acquaints the Soothſayers with it, who inform the King concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it; he then cauſes all the young Men and Maids to be call'd together out of the Camp, ſends them into the Woods to Hunt out a wild Beaſt, which they no ſooner ſee, but they return and acquaint the Multitude therewith, who immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately ſurrounding the Place, ſoon catch the Beaſt, whoſe Entrails they pull out and throw to the Dogs; and give the Fleſh to the Women to roaſt, which when ready they make merry with, Singing and Dancing after they have eaten; then if the Youth hath behav'd himſelf well in purſuing of the wild Beaſt, the King grants him the Maid which he deſires for his Wife: Four days before the Wedding they bore a Hole through each of the Bridegrooms Cheeks with a ſharp piece of Wood, which done they ſolemnize the Marriage; at which the King himſelf diſtributes the Meat to every Gueſt as he thinks fit; after Din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner they extol the Mothers Care, in preſerving her Daughters Virginity for the Bridegroom in ſtrange Songs. If a Maid be Marriageable, and no Suitor comes to her, then the Mother draws red Strokes under her Eyes, and conducts her to the King, who ſets the Maid down by him on a Mat, warms his Hands againſt the Fire, then ſtroaks himſelf and the Maid, and alſo blows Tobacco-Smoak on her and himſelf, which done, he performs the part of a Husband with her. But their making Holes through their Ears and Lips is done whileſt they are Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, after this manner: The Boys who undergo this Ceremony, come to the Place appointed, where the whole Multitude Dance and Sing, and the Conju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers (who are the onely Prieſts they have) ſit in two rows oppoſite to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;

Women refuſe to have any familiarity with their Husbands as ſoon as they perceive themſelves to be with Child; and as ſoon as any Woman is Deliver'd, ſhe runs into a neighboring Wood, where with a Shell ſhe cuts off the Childs Navel, which boyling ſhe eats with the After-birth; then waſhes her ſelf and the Child every Morning and Evening in cold Water; as long as ſhe gives Suck her Husband lies not with her, unleſs it be a Man that hath but one Wife.

<pb n="493" facs="tcp:56274:326"/>they might diſcover his Plot, wherefore he charg'd them that they ſhould not ſtir a foot from his Company, which they accordingly promis'd, and having march'd three days through By-ways, they daily perform'd their Devotion in open view, and <hi>Arciſſeusky</hi> deſir'd that they would call him when their Devil appear'd, which they granted, on promiſe that he ſhould not do him any hurt: On the third day the Army being ſufficiently refreſh'd, he being call'd, found the <hi>Tapuyans</hi> ſitting in a Semi-Circle, with their Feet ſpread aſunder; oppoſite to them ſat their Prieſt on the Ground, whom they ask'd concerning all manner of Affairs, and he queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd them again, on which they gave their ſeveral Anſwers, but could not be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood for want of Interpreters; for thoſe whom the <hi>Hollanders</hi> us'd ſpake only two Languages, one of which is us'd commonly by the <hi>Braſilians</hi> along the Sea-Coaſt, and the other by the <hi>Portugueſe,</hi> in which they Interpreted to the <hi>Hollanders</hi> as much as poſſibly they could underſtand of what the <hi>Tapuyans</hi> ſaid, whoſe Language dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers very much from the vulgar <hi>Braſile</hi> Tongue, becauſe they live up in the Inland, and are divided into divers Tribes, ſo that the Interpreters could not underſtand the <hi>Tapuyans,</hi> but judg'd their meaning more by nodding of the Head, and the like ſigns: after the Aſſembly had done ſpeaking, the Prieſt roſe up and went out of their ſights into the Wood, where with a loud voice he call'd three times upon the Devil; but he not anſwering, the Prieſt return'd to his Company, who began their Queſtions and Anſwers afreſh, which could not be underſtood by the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters; and ſoon after the Prieſt (ſeeming to be commanded by the reſt) went again to the Wood, but calling ſtill in vain, return'd; then going a third time, and calling as before, was by a ſmall, but ſhrill Voice, anſwer'd from the middle of the Wood, from which the <hi>Tapuyans</hi> concluded that their Buſineſs would come to perfection, and that the Devil would ſoon appear to them: The Prieſt hereupon going backwards and forwards three times one after another to his Company, they began to talk as before; at laſt going into the Wood again, they all ſpoke louder, and with more vehemency than before, whileſt the fore-mention'd ſhrill Voice approached nearer and nearer, and at laſt the ſuppoſed <hi>Daemon</hi> came forth with the Prieſt, who commanded him to ſit oppoſite to the Congregation, which had a great deal of Diſcourſe, and ſometimes the Prieſt ſpeaking was anſwer'd by the Devil in his ſhrill Voice; but ſome of the People calling aloud, catch'd up their Arms, and threatned to beat the Devil, as they often us'd to do upon the like occaſions. At the departure of the <hi>Daemon,</hi> the Multitude conducted by the Prieſt into the Wood, cry'd out in ſo terrible a manner, that they affrighted the <hi>Hollan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> who judg'd it rather to be Lyons and Tygers that roar'd than Men.

                  <note place="margin">The Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture.</note>The Learned <hi>Gerard Voſsius</hi> made a particular Enquiry after this Story, whether the Spirit's appearance were a Reality, or an Impoſture; and the truth is it was no better than a ſubtile Cheat, and ſo it was apprehended by <hi>Arciſſeusky,</hi> who not long after, on a convenient time, ask'd the <hi>Tapuyans</hi> why they feign'd him to be a Devil that was a Man, whom he had often ſeen before? which they denying, affirm'd
<pb n="494" facs="tcp:56274:327"/>that it was a real Devil; but <hi>Arciſſeusky</hi> knew their pretended Friend, who ſpake ſo ſhrill by reaſon of a Graſs-blade which he held in his Mouth.

               <p>After this <hi>Arciſſeusky</hi> burnt ſeveral <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Ships in the River <hi>Monguoape,</hi> and kept one, carrying ten Demi-Cuiverins, laden with Sugar and <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Wine; which to carry to a ſafe Harbor a ſhort Way, he requir'd the <hi>Tapuyans</hi> aſſiſtance; but they refus'd to enter, pretending the Ship would periſh by ſome or other unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Accident, which accordingly hapned as they had ſaid; for the Ship was ſplit againſt a Rock in the Mouth of a narrow Haven, inſomuch that nothing of it was ſav'd; all which the <hi>Tapuyans</hi> knew beforehand by the Devil's information, for they never go upon any Buſineſs of conſequence before they have conſulted with him, and done him worſhip. Yet, it ſeems, they cannot ſecure this Devil of theirs from the Stripes of a Mortal,<note place="margin">A pleaſant Story be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Arciſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeusky</hi> and a <hi>Tapuyan</hi> Prieſt.</note> as appears by this pleaſant Story: A <hi>Tapuyan</hi> Prieſt was promis'd a Shirt from <hi>Arciſſeusky,</hi> upon condition the Devil ſhould pull the ſame out of his Hand and carry it up in the Air: The <hi>Tapuyan</hi> liking the Propoſal, promis'd immediately to call the Devil; but when <hi>Arciſſeusky</hi> deſir'd leave to Drub him with a Stick which he had in his Hand, he could by no means perſwade the Prieſt to call for his <hi>Daemon;</hi> at which every one began to laugh: and to carry on the Mirth farther, <hi>Arciſſeusky</hi> Joking with the Prieſt, ſaid, <hi>I will ſhew you that I am a greater Artiſt than you, for to Morrow I will bring it about by my Art, that great Horns ſhall grow on your Head, ſo big, that you ſhall not be able to paſs theſe Doors;</hi> which ſo af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighted the <hi>Tapuyans,</hi> that all of them fled, onely the Prieſt return'd the next day with an Interpreter to <hi>Arciſſeusky,</hi> deſiring him that he would uſe him mercifully, and not cauſe any Horns to grow on his Head.</p>

                     <hi>Olinda,</hi> formerly the chief City of <hi>Pernambuco,</hi> had (according to <hi>Lopez</hi>) above three thouſand Houſes and ſeventy Sugar-Mills: It is built on ſeveral Hills, which on the North-ſide are ſteep and overgrown with Brambles, betwixt which in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny places grow Orange-Trees. <hi>John Newhof,</hi> who arriv'd at <hi>Olinda</hi> Anno 1642. found a few <hi>Netherlanders</hi> and <hi>Spaniards</hi> there, who dwelt in the ruin'd Houſes. The Land-ſide of the City is ſtrengthned by Hills overgrown with Brambles and Thorns, and towards the Sea-ſide with Earthen Walls, fortifi'd by fourteen Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warks and a Stone Caſtle, able to withſtand a conſiderable force: The Out-works towards the South were maintain'd by <hi>Jews,</hi> who from the fore-mention'd Hills
<pb n="506" facs="tcp:56274:337"/>could ſee not onely a great way into the Ocean, but alſo the River <hi>Biberibi,</hi> which hath a Stone Bridge leading to the City, and Northerly and Weſtward the Way lies through great Woods and Forreſts. <hi>Olinda</hi> it ſelf is divided into twenty ſeven large Streets, beſides leſſer Lanes and ſeveral Avenues, and five chief Churches, <hi>viz. Miſericordia, Noſtra Sennora del Emparo,</hi> and <hi>Noſtra Sennora de Guadalupe, San Salvador,</hi> and <hi>San Pedro,</hi> beſides two others of leſſer note. On the higheſt Hill ſtands the <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits</hi> Cloyſter, built ſquare and high, and ſurrounded with Walls, on which <hi>Seba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian</hi> King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> by the perſwaſion of his Uncle Cardinal <hi>Henry,</hi> ſpent a great ſum of Money, and endow'd it with annual Revenues, <hi>Anno</hi> 1571. The <hi>Capuchins</hi> alſo built a ſtately Cloyſter towards the Eaſt. The <hi>Franciſcans</hi> moreover inhabited a magnificent Building, near which ſtood the Governors Palace. The <hi>Carmelites</hi> had alſo a ſtately Edifice, whoſe former luſtre ſtill appears by the Ruines, where now Cattel graze; from the Hills about which may be exactly diſcern'd <hi>Reciffa,</hi> the Promontory of <hi>St. Auguſtine,</hi> and the Caſtle before the Road of <hi>Reciffa:</hi> Along the Shore ſtood the <hi>Dominican</hi> Cloyſter, and in the upper part of the City the Minſter, Conſecrated to <hi>St. Bento,</hi> exceeding ſtrong both by Nature and Art; near which ſtood <hi>Conceptio de noſtra Sennora.</hi> The Fort <hi>Juan de Albuquerque</hi> ſtood on the South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, from whence a Way leads you along the Shore to <hi>Reciffa,</hi> where hard by the Potter's Houſe ſtood a Beacon. But ſince <hi>Olinda</hi> fell into the hands of the <hi>Nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land Eaſt-India</hi> Company, they built a ſtrong Fortreſs on the North near the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, where formerly a great Trade was driven with Sugar, inſomuch that forty Ships have been fraighted in a day therewith from <hi>Olinda,</hi> and ſtill as much more remain'd in the Store-houſes. The Sugar cannot be made without the help of <hi>African</hi> Slaves, and that in great numbers; for <hi>Angola</hi> alone provided fifteen thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand four hundred and thirty <hi>Moors</hi> for the Sugar-Mills about <hi>Olinda.</hi>

The Men pluck out all the Hair of their Foreheads, but ſuffer it to hang pretty long over their Ears, and behind. The Women let their Hair hang down to their Middle, and wear woodden Ear-rings; but the Men hang green Beads in their Lips, and thruſt, little Bones through their Noſes.

                     <p>
                        <hi>Frambore,</hi> King of this Place, granted <hi>Lam</hi> and <hi>Veron</hi> free liberty to Hunt, and to gather as many Oranges and Lemmons as they pleas'd, with which the Seamen were ſo refreſh'd, that they ſet Sail again, and amongſt many other things carry'd a Baboon with them from <hi>Sierra Leona,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">A ſtrange kind of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boon.</note> which ſo exactly reſembled a Man, that it was wonderful to behold, having a Body, Hands, Eyes, Ears, Feet, and Actions like a Man, ſmoak'd Tobacco amongſt the Seamen, made a noiſe like a Child when beaten.

                     <p>The Fleet, as is before mention'd, Sailing from <hi>Sierra Leona,</hi> came to an Anchor at <hi>Commany,</hi> and Landed twelve hundred Men at <hi>Poquena,</hi> beſides a hundred and fifty <hi>Negro's;</hi> which Regiment <hi>Andries Veron</hi> and <hi>Arend Jacobſzoon</hi> carry'd to the Caſtle <hi>Del Mine,</hi>

                     <p>During the unfortunate Expedition of this Fleet, the <hi>Weſt-India Company</hi> fitted out nine great Ships and five Ketches in the beginning of the Year 1626. under the Command of <hi>Peter Peterſzoon Hein,</hi> to Cruiſe for the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ships that were expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted from <hi>New Spain</hi> and <hi>Honduras.</hi>

                     <p>Mean while the Admiral <hi>Peter Heyn,</hi> in the beginning of <hi>June,</hi> Sail'd to the Southward of <hi>Barbados,</hi> Iſland pretty mountainous, as hath been formerly men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd, and full of Woods, and by <hi>Martinino,</hi> whoſe Hills are very high and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grown with Trees. Here <hi>Peter Heyn</hi> could get nothing elſe but ſweet Water, and a Fruit reſembling a green Grape, which grew on a round Leav'd Tree, whoſe Juice cur'd the Scurvey. Sailing from hence, and Landing on <hi>Guadalupa,</hi> he found a <hi>Canoo</hi> ſeven Fathom long and one broad, and cut out of one Tree. The Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, a well timber'd People, went ſtark naked, and deſir'd to be excus'd, that they could not furniſh the <hi>Hollanders</hi> with more Proviſions, becauſe the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh,</hi> Inhabitants of <hi>St. Chriſtophers,</hi> had pillag'd them.</p>
                     <p>Near <hi>Mona</hi> the <hi>Fox</hi> Frigat joyn'd with the Fleet, with information, that he could hear no tydings of <hi>Henrickſzoon;</hi> wherefore <hi>Peter Heyn</hi> judg'd it convenient to Sail along the South-Coaſt of <hi>Hispaniola</hi> with a ſeparated Fleet, which was to joyn again near the great <hi>Caiman.</hi> Near <hi>Cape de Corientes</hi> the <hi>Dutch</hi> took a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ship laden with <hi>Sarſaparilla;</hi> after that another with Salt and Fiſh, and on the Shelves before <hi>Coche</hi> before the Promontory <hi>Antonio,</hi> a Fly-boat with Tallow and Hides, and at the ſame places two Veſſels more with Ballaſt, the Men whereof inform'd him, that the Fleet from <hi>New Spain</hi> had about a Moneth before weigh'd Anchor from the Haven <hi>Juan de Ulva,</hi> and ſet Sail to <hi>Havana,</hi> ſo that without doubt they were arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved there; wherefore <hi>Peter Heyn</hi> ſteer'd towards <hi>Tortugos,</hi> in hopes, if he could, to overtake ſome of the heavy Sailers. Before the Promontory <hi>De Florida</hi> he diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd ſeven Sail, and coming up nearer, above thirty, which, had <hi>Henrickſzoon</hi> been united with <hi>Peter Heyn,</hi> had without doubt fallen into the hands of the <hi>Netherlanders;</hi> but it being judg'd a madneſs to ſet upon ſo great a Fleet with ſo ſmall a number of Ships, they Sail'd away undiſturb'd. <hi>Peter Heyn</hi> ſteer'd his Courſe along <hi>Florida,</hi> where he met three <hi>Canoos</hi> with ſtrange Men in them, who came aboard of him, their Bodies being naked, were painted with ſeveral colours, onely Mats of Ruſhes about their Middle, and on their Backs long Taſſels hanging down: their Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandiſe conſiſted of a ſort of Gum of little value. The <hi>Netherlanders</hi> in this Place took alſo a Veſſel with <hi>Sina</hi> Leaves, and ſome pounds of Ambergreece: but the Scurvey increaſing daily amongſt them, they Tack'd about, and ran to an Anchor at <hi>Sierra Leona,</hi> where they ſtay'd till the latter end of <hi>January</hi> 1627. and then ſet Sail to <hi>Braſile,</hi> and overtook a Veſſel from <hi>Madera</hi> laden with a hundred and fifty Pipes of Wine, and other rich Goods, and ran into the Inlet <hi>Todos los Sanctos</hi> with undaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted courage, not regarding the Guns that were fir'd from the Fort and Battlements of the City <hi>St. Salvador,</hi> near which lay thirty Sail of Ships, to which he making up,<note place="margin">Succeſs of the <hi>Dutch</hi> againſt the <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueſe</hi> Fleet.</note> ſteer'd between the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Admiral and Rere-Admiral, whom ſinking, he forc'd the Admiral to ſurrender, whileſt the <hi>Hollandia</hi> and <hi>Geldria</hi> Frigats fell upon the reſt, which were forſaken by the Seamen, who leap'd over-board; then ſeveral Mann'd Boats of the <hi>Hollanders</hi> (notwithſtanding the Enemy's continual firing) went and fetch'd off twenty two Sail of the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Veſſels; all which they did in three hours time, onely with the loſs of fifty Men, beſides ſome that were wounded, amongſt whom was the Admiral, being ſhot with a Bullet through the Arm, and wounded in the Legs with a Splinter; his Ship alſo was, with the <hi>Gelria</hi> Frigat, driven with the Spring-Tide on a Bank, whence, after the <hi>Gelria</hi> had receiv'd above ſixty Shot from the Enemy, they both got off at laſt; but the Admiral's, Frigat be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhot in a manner to a Wreck, was ſet on fire; which Misfortune ended not there, for the <hi>Orange-tree</hi> Frigat blew up, with ſixty Men, fourteen whereof, though miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably
<pb n="526" facs="tcp:56274:355"/>ſcorch'd, had their Lives ſav'd. Soon after which the Admiral ſent into <hi>Holland</hi> the Ship <hi>St. Peter,</hi> the <hi>Hoop, Noſtra Sennora de la Vittoria,</hi> and the <hi>Black-Lyon,</hi> which beſides their Lading of Hides, Silver, Gold, and Precious Stones, were moſt of them full of Sugar; which ſafely arriving, did not a little encourage the <hi>Weſt-India</hi> Company. After this <hi>Heyn</hi> took two Ships with Slaves from <hi>Angola,</hi> which becauſe the Governor of <hi>St. Salvador</hi> would not redeem, were put aſhore on <hi>Taperica.</hi> On the laſt of <hi>March</hi> he ſet Sail from the Inlet <hi>Todos los Sanctos,</hi> paſs'd by <hi>Mono Pablo,</hi> and on <hi>Eaſter</hi> Eve with a ſtrong Gale by the <hi>Abrolhos:</hi> before the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land between <hi>Cape Frio</hi> and the River <hi>De Jenero,</hi> he diſcover'd two Sail, one whereof being laden with Sugar was taken, but the other eſcap'd in the Night; then Sail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on to the meandring Stream <hi>Spirito Sancto,</hi> he digg'd Pits on ſome of the River-Iſles to get freſh Water, becauſe it was not ſafe to Land on the Continent on each ſide, becauſe the Inhabitants ſhot frequent ſhowers of Arrows from the Thickets, in which they lay ambuſcaded. Moreover the Town <hi>Spirito Sancto</hi> ſent off ſeveral Fire-ſhips at the time of Flood, but they being eaſily quench'd did no harm. Here alſo a Veſſel laden at <hi>Lisbon</hi> with Wines and Piece-Goods, was taken by <hi>Heyn,</hi> who ſetting Sail again divided the Fleet into three Squadrons, the Vice-Admiral <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelis Oole</hi> keeping three Ships to Cruiſe withal before the River <hi>La Plata, Henrick Beſt</hi> had one Frigat, a Ketch, and a Carvel, to guard the Mouth of the Stream <hi>Jenero,</hi> whileſt the Admiral himſelf Sail'd with four Frigats, three Ketches, and a Barque, towards the Inlet <hi>Todos los Sanctos,</hi> where two Ships riding near the Shore by the Fort <hi>Tapecipe,</hi> were by him ſet on fire. Alſo taking a Barque he was inform'd, that ſix laden Veſſels lay in the River <hi>Tapecipe,</hi> whither he ſending ſome Boats to explore the truth, they found a great Ship without Men in the Mouth of the Stream, and half a League farther ſix <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Veſſels lying near the Shore; bringing back news thereof to the Admiral, he went aboard of the <hi>Fox</hi> Ketch the next Morning, and taking two Ketches and ſeveral Boats with him, Sail'd up the River, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd that the fore-mention'd ſix Ships were gotten up higher, and were Mann'd with a hundred and fifty Soldiers, Commanded by Captain <hi>Padilha;</hi> the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Admiral lying in Ambuſcade, no ſooner perceiv'd the <hi>Netherlanders</hi> Boats, but he let flie a whole Volley of ſmall Shot at them, inſomuch that it made them Retreat, and their whole Deſign had been fruitleſs, had not <hi>Heyn</hi> animated his Men to board the Vice-Admiral; which encouragement prov'd ſo ſucceſsful that they maſter'd the ſame, killing all thoſe that fell into their hands; which ſo amaz'd the two Veſſels that lay by, that all the Men ſwam aſhore, and left their rich Lading to the diſpoſal of the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> beſides which the vanquiſh'd Party loſt above a hundred and fifty Men, and the Conquerors but fifteen. Somewhat farther up lay three Ships more, but the River being dry there at Low-water, and ſo narrow that the Trees on each Shore could touch one another, <hi>Heyn</hi> judg'd it convenient to proſecute the Deſign no farther, but to return with the three for-mention'd Prizes, which he did not without great difficulty; for the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> had rais'd Battlements on each ſide of the Mouth of the River <hi>Tapecipe,</hi> and ſtopt the ſame with a ſunk Veſſel, which <hi>Heyn</hi> himſelf ſet on fire at Low-water, and return'd untouch'd through thick Volleys of Shot, which flew about his Ears to the Fleet, leaving the three Ships to be fetcht off afterwards; to which end he commanded that they ſhould hang ſome of the taken Hides about the <hi>Fox</hi> Ketch's Pinnace, the Carvel and Boats, that ſo the Men which were in them might ſtand ſecure from the ſmall Shot, and the rather, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Ships could not be got out of the ſhallow and narrow River but by Toe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Mean while the Governor of <hi>St. Salvador</hi> lay with a conſiderable number of Citizens and Soldiers behind the fore-mention'd Battlements, not doubting but to

                     <p>Several Diſadvantages occurr'd towards the overthrow of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Fleet; for firſt it was much weakned by the Diſeaſe which rag'd in the ſame on the Coaſt of <hi>Africa,</hi> inſomuch that it lay ſtill a whole year in <hi>Todos los Sanctos</hi> to gather freſh For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, whileſt <hi>Maurice</hi> put himſelf in a poſture of Defence: Secondly, they lay be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calm'd, and met with contrary Winds for ſeveral Moneths, when as the Voyage be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>St. Salvador</hi> and <hi>Pemambuco</hi> is commonly not above twelve days; which tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Paſſage occaſion'd alſo a Diſtemper and faint-heartedneſs amongſt the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> whileſt divers Ships arriv'd at <hi>Reciffa</hi> from the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> without which it had been impoſſible to have Engag'd with the Enemy, in regard till then all manner of Ammunition and Proviſions were wanting. <hi>Huigens</hi> alſo had continually the advantage or benefit of the Wind, and loſt in the Engagement but two Ships, a hundred and twenty four Men, beſides twelve wounded: Moreover, but twelve
<pb n="570" facs="tcp:56274:382"/>Ships onely of the <hi>Dutch</hi> Engag'd with this great <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Fleet, the reſt never coming within ſhot; wherefore the two Commanders, <hi>John Coopman Ryk,</hi> and <hi>Peter Jacob,</hi> were condemn'd to be Beheaded; <hi>Cornelis Johnſzoon</hi> and <hi>Peter Dirkſzoon</hi> had their Swords broke over their Heads by the common Hangman; <hi>Cornelis Lucifer, Dirk Eger,</hi> and <hi>Jacob Clavor,</hi> were baniſh'd; and others came off by paying great Fines: but the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Fleet loſt in the four Engagements twenty Ships, and ſome thouſands of Men, the <hi>Joſeph</hi> alone having four hundred ſlain in her.

                     <p>Before the foremention'd Fleet weigh'd Anchor from <hi>St. Salvador,</hi> two thouſand <hi>Portugueſes,</hi> beſides <hi>Tapuyans</hi> and other <hi>Braſilians,</hi> march'd under the Command of <hi>Cameron, Vidal,</hi> and <hi>Barbalio,</hi> with divided Forces into the Countrey, partly to get Proviſion, and partly to do what miſchief they could to the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> far and near: their Orders were to joyn in the Village <hi>St. Laurence,</hi> ſeven Leagues be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond <hi>Paomarello,</hi> that there they might make way for the Seamen to Land, if the <hi>Netherland</hi> Forces ſhould chance to guard the Sea-Coaſt thereabouts, and to joyn with them as ſoon as they were Landed.

                     <p>About the beginning of the Year 1640. <hi>Houte-been</hi> and <hi>Lichthart</hi> brought a conſiderable Fleet from the <hi>Netherlands</hi> to an Anchor at <hi>Reciffa,</hi> where a Conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation was held, whither theſe Ships might be ſent to do moſt Service: every one had an Eye on St. <hi>Salvador,</hi> not long ſince Storm'd in vain; but <hi>Maurice</hi> judg'd that they had not Forces enough to undertake ſo grand a Deſign, but thought it would be better to Land ſome freſh Forces near St. <hi>Salvador,</hi> that there they might burn the Sugar-Mills, and deſtroy all things they could find, in revenge of what the Enemy had done at <hi>Parayba.</hi> Whereupon <hi>Tourlon</hi> and <hi>Lichthart</hi> ſet Sail with twenty Ships, Mann'd with two thouſand five hundred Men, to the Inlet <hi>Todos los Sanctos,</hi> where they burnt all the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Sugar-Mills, Houſes and Villages; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did their Swords ſpare any alive but Women and Infants: The Cattel which they found they carry'd aboard of their Ships, and burnt all other Proviſions.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time <hi>Houte-been</hi> and <hi>Coin</hi> fell upon <hi>Porto Franco,</hi> where they ruin'd all things, to no other end, but that the Enemy might call home his Forces out of the <hi>Netherlanders Braſile,</hi> to defend the Province <hi>Todos los Sanctos.</hi>

                        </note> becauſe he led an undiſciplin'd Company, and wanted little Veſſels to Land in on a ſudden; for the Enemy having had timely notice, immediately rais'd a Sconce about the Town, and with five Braſs Guns fir'd ſtoutly on him, who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavor'd to climb up the Hill, but was forc'd to ſound a Retreat, his Men failing in their Courage; yet at laſt breaking into the Town, he ſet ſome of the Houſes on fire, which being built of Stone, reſiſted the Flame; ſo burning onely four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and fifty Cheſts of Sugar, he left ſixty Men kill'd, and brought back eighty wounded. <hi>Lichthart</hi> in the mean time made great havock about St. <hi>Salvador.</hi>

                     <hi>ROdulphus Baron,</hi> to make a Diſcovery of the Countrey, upon the Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Grave Maurice,</hi> who allow'd him to that purpoſe a yearly Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue, undertook a remarkable Journey, accompany'd with three <hi>Tapuyans;</hi> who goings out of the Village <hi>Caneri</hi> without any ſtore of Proviſions, left the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains <hi>Cupaeva</hi> on the right-hand, and went ſeventy Leagues into the Countrey, without meeting with any People, onely he found one Mountain of <hi>Foſsile</hi> Glaſs; from whence he went Southward to the Villages of the <hi>Waripebares</hi> and <hi>Caripati,</hi> who having courteouſly Entertain'd him, appointed certain Perſons to accompany him from one Village to another, with Orders to Complement <hi>Grave Maurice,</hi> who ſent them home with ſeveral Gifts.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Waripebares</hi> and <hi>Caripati</hi> inhabit fourteen Villages on the Mountains which Bound <hi>Braſile</hi> Weſtward, live by Hunting and Fiſhing, eat wild Honey and all manner of Fruit, and maintain continual Wars againſt a mighty People which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habit the Weſtern Plains.</p>

At theſe Ceremonies, which end with Dancing and Singing, their King is always preſent.</p>

                  <p>So ſoon as a Woman is gotten with Child by her Husband, ſhe lies no more with him, but he is permitted to enjoy his other Wives, whoſe number is either more or leſs, according to every ones pleaſure. The Women after Delivery eat their After-birth.</p>
                  <p>Adultery is free for Men, but if Women be taken in the Act, they are immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately put to Death.</p>
                  <p>After they have done Soweing and Planting, the King calls all his People and Subjects together, and appears to them hung round with Garlands; and all of them have their Bodies Painted and ſtuck full of divers colour'd Feathers.</p>

When the Waters overflowing <hi>Braſile</hi> did much harm, <hi>Anno</hi> 1641. the Prieſts being Conſulted, brought forth the King's <hi>Calabaſh,</hi> in which lay their ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Stones call'd <hi>Cohuterak</hi> and <hi>Titſcheyouh,</hi> and began to Dance and Sing; next ſix Prieſts were plac'd in a row, which were to Prognoſticate: whereupon the firſt taking up a Stone, ſaid, <hi>The</hi> Netherlanders <hi>have given Battel to thoſe in</hi> St. Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor, <hi>but are now about an Agreement:</hi> The ſecond held up a Bloſſom of <hi>Indian</hi> Wheat, and foretold that there would be plenty of that Grain: The third holding a white Pebble-ſtone, promis'd ſtore of Milk: The fourth graſp'd a Stone like Bread, telling them that the Countrey ſhould produce much Bread: The fifth holding up a Bowe and Arrow hung full of Feathers, cry'd aloud, <hi>This is a Gift of the Angels, Birds ſhall flie thicker than theſe Feathers hang together:</hi> The ſixth, having a lump of Wax, foretold that there would be plenty of Honey made by the Bees that year.</p>

Next the River ſtood a large Stable, on one ſide whereof was a Field to whiten Linnen in, and a Kitchin-Garden, wherein was a large Spot full of Orange-Trees, a row of Vines, which bore Grapes every three Moneths, and a delightful Walk, beſet on each ſide with Lime-Trees. On the other ſide of this Palace ſtood a Banquetting-houſe, near a row of Pome-granate-Trees, and another of Fig and Cittron-Trees. Behind the Palace was a Fiſh-pond with two Iles, for the Swans. A Dove-houſe alſo appear'd near the Fort <hi>Erneſtus,</hi> where the <hi>Negro's</hi> watch'd the Horſes, and led them to Water in a Fiſhpond in a large Wood. Before the Palace appear'd a Stone Palliſado, which like a Half-Moon ran into the River. The Palace it ſelf roſe with two Towers, one of which ſerv'd for a Sea-mark.</p>

               <p>This Countrey lieth on both ſides of the <hi>Aequator,</hi> extended from the fourth Degree of Southern Latitude, to the eighth Degree of Northern, yet enjoyeth a temperate and good Air, not oppreſſed with any exceſſive Heat; which is chiefly attributed to the Breezes, or Eaſterly Winds, almoſt perpetually about Noon blowing upon it. Towards the Sea-ſide it is for the moſt part a flat and level Countrey, in the more Inland parts mountainous and ſwell'd with Hills, but in all it is generally of ſuch a rich and fertile Soil, that for Fruits, or any outward Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities of the Earth, it yields not to any other Province of the <hi>New World,</hi> but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther far excelleth the moſt, having as it were a continual Summer, without Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or Autumn, the Trees never uncloth'd or made bare, Fruits always ripe, or growing to maturity, the Meadows and Paſtures always verdant and green, and, as we ſaid, ſo excellently well water'd with Rivers, that no Countrey in the World ſeems comparable to it in this reſpect. But ſince the ſeveral Occurrences of <hi>Orella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi>'s Expedition will give much light to the more particular knowledge of theſe Parts, we thought good to inſert this following Relation thereof.</p>

The Pearl-Banks were cover'd with five, ſix, ſeven, or eight Fathom Water; from whence the <hi>Negro's</hi> pull'd the Oyſters with ſuch force, that the Blood guſh'd out of their Mouths and Noſes when they came above Water to breath; after which, to refreſh them, they receiv'd a Glaſs of Wine and a Pipe of Tobacco.

               <p>The Seamen who went under <hi>Hendrick Brewer's</hi> Command, <hi>Anno</hi> 1643. from <hi>Braſile</hi> to <hi>Chili,</hi> brought the fore-mention'd Vocabulary along with them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Chili</hi> is look'd upon as no way inferior to any Countrey in <hi>America,</hi> enjoying a wholſom Air, fruitful Soil, and abundance of Inhabitants, who often furniſh <hi>Peru</hi> with Proviſions; which are the ſpeedier convey'd thither, becauſe the South-Winds always blow along the Coaſt.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Peruvian</hi> Vice-Roy keeps a Deputy to Govern here. It hath two Biſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricks, <hi>viz.</hi> St. <hi>Jago</hi> and <hi>L' Imperial.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The Nature, Cuſtoms, and Manners of the <hi>Chileſes.</hi>
                  </note>Some of the <hi>Chileſes</hi> are under the <hi>Spaniards</hi> Juriſdiction, and live in Huts; others being wilder, defend their Freedom with the Sword. They have great Heads and flat Noſes: The Men continually pull out the Hair on their Faces and Privities with Shells, which they carry about their Necks for that purpoſe, having beforehand rubb'd the Hair with warm Aſhes; the Hair of their Heads hanging downwards is cut cloſe as far as their Ears, the reſt growing long, is ty'd with the Ribbon <hi>Tariwelonco,</hi> to which Perſons of Quality fix Silver Plates and <hi>Turkoiſes:</hi> Some alſo cover their Heads with the Skins of Weazels, or the like Beaſts, putting the Head over their Foreheads, and the Tail down their Neck; which kind of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering they call <hi>Maniewelonco:</hi> Others wear Caps made after ſome ſtrange manner or other.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Chileſes</hi> are not the talleſt, but ſtrong and well ſet, betwixt a white and ſallow colour: Thoſe that are in the <hi>Spaniards</hi> Service, wear long Hair, by which they are diſtinguiſh'd from the ſhorn <hi>Ucais,</hi> who do the <hi>Spaniards</hi> all the miſchief imaginable. The Women are for the moſt part low of ſtature, but of a ſtrong Conſtitution; they go bare-headed, letting their Hair hang looſe over their Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, except when they are indiſpos'd, and then they tie it up: But thoſe that dwell about <hi>Caſtro</hi> wear Locks like our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ladies. In <hi>Coquimbo</hi> and <hi>Loquimbo</hi> they go after the ſame manner as the <hi>Peruvian</hi> Women: All of them have thick black Hair.</p>
               <p>Their Apparel, though mean, is neat: The Men wear wide Breeches girt about their Waſtes, and a piece of woollen Cloth, three Yards long and two broad, which
<pb n="641" facs="tcp:56274:428"/>having a Hole in the middle, they put over their Heads, and ſo let it hang on their Shoulders, leaving their Arms and Legs bare; but on Feſtival Days they wear curious embroider'd Stockings. The Women likewiſe cover themſelves with the ſame piece of Cloth, but after another manner, tying it firſt about their Middle, then let it down to the Ground, pinn'd before with Silver or Golden Pins; their Heads, Breaſts and Legs are uncover'd; the Cloth it ſelf is ſtrip'd with red, white, blue, and yellow, and fring'd at the edges. For an Example of their quick and eaſie Labor, <hi>Hendrick Brewer</hi> relates, That a Woman being Deliver'd in his Ship, within an hour after walk'd up and down the Deck, and gave the Child ſuck. Some of them have ſuch great Breaſts, that throwing them over their Shoulders they ſuckle their Children, being ty'd at their Backs.</p>
               <p>Their Huts being low, are made of Straw, Canes, and Boughs, and not built for one ſingle Family; for often thirty, fifty, a hundred, or a hundred and twenty dwell under one Roof, and have a Governor, by them call'd <hi>Caruca.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Their Houſholdſtuff is little and mean, <hi>viz.</hi> two or three Cans to keep their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor <hi>Chica</hi> in, Horn Cups, a Stone whereon they grind their Corn, and one or two woodden Stools: The chiefeſt of them alſo uſe Sheep-skins, which they ſpread on the Ground before their Gueſts. They live without care, for they neither Sowe nor Plant any more than will ſerve them a Year.</p>
               <p>Their Riches conſiſt in Cattel, of which they have no great plenty.</p>
               <p>About the beginning of <hi>October</hi> a whole Town meets together to Plough and to Sowe, which the Men perform in two days time, the reſt of the Work being left to the care of the Women; for the Men never meddle with Reaping or Harveſt.</p>
               <p>They eat and drink from Morning to Evening, when they do not travel, for then they eat at ſet-times. Their Liquor is made of Barley-Meal, or Wheat boyl'd in Water. On Feſtival Days they drink <hi>Chica,</hi> Brew'd of <hi>Maiz</hi> chew'd by the Teeth of old Women. They likewiſe make a Liquor of the Fruit <hi>Unni,</hi> which taſtes like <hi>Madera</hi> Wine.</p>
               <p>Every Man Marries as many Wives as he can buy and maintain,<note place="margin">Their Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages.</note> for Maids and Widows muſt be ſold by the Parents, who ſet not a Price upon them according to their Beauty or Quality, but their skill in managing Houſhold Affairs. Their Marriages are perform'd after a ſtrange manner: A Son having no Inheritance, lives on the Charity of his neareſt Relations, who Preſent him, one with a Hog, another with a Cow, a third with a Sheep, and a fourth with ſomewhat elſe: thus enrich'd, he goes to his Miſtreſſes Father, and hangs ſome <hi>Turkoiſes</hi> and Plates of Silver about his Neck, and acquainting him with what Eſtate he can make his Wife, he agrees as well as he can with his intended Father-in-law, to whom he gives ten, fifty, or a hundred Sheep, Oxen, Cows, Hogs, Horſes, Poultrey, a Coat, and ſome Veſſels full of <hi>Chica;</hi> which done, the Father leads his Daughter to the Bridegroom's Houſe, where he is Entertain'd with Meat, but finds the Drink at his own Coſt. Some days after the Celebration of the Wedding, the neareſt Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons come to congratulate the young Marry'd Woman, and at Dinner ſing an <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thalamium</hi> to their Nuptial Deity <hi>Maruapeante,</hi> all of them ſitting on the Ground on Sheep-skins. The Allies often take away a Woman from her Husband, eſpecially when he miſuſes her; and if a Man kill his Wife, her Death is reveng'd by her Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Perſons of Quality build a Hut for every one of their Wives, ſending word to her whom they have a mind to enjoy: They reſpect one above the reſt, who are in a manner but Slaveſſes, being forc'd to do all the Drudgery. The Men are exceeding jealous and chollerick, cruelly beating their Wives, if they chance but to look on another Man; and if they take them in the Act of Adultery, they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
<pb n="642" facs="tcp:56274:429"/>kill them; yet for all this they are not Chaſte, but very Libidinous. As ſoon as a Woman is Deliver'd of a Child, ſhe waſhes her ſelf and the Child in cold Water; then kills a Lamb call'd <hi>Chiluraque,</hi> and makes a Feaſt; at which ſhe her ſelf eats and drinks freely amongſt the reſt, and the next day goes about her uſual Employment.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Spaniards</hi> tell us, that their Women, if they continue long in this Countrey, are more and more hardned by the Air, and are as little concern'd at the Birth of a Child as the Natives.</p>
               <p>A Widow hath free leave to Marry again, provided ſhe hath given to her Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren part of what ſhe hath; but if ſhe Marry not, but return to her Parents, then ſhe is highly eſteem'd of.</p>
               <p>Both Men and Women waſh themſelves in the Rivers in the coldeſt Weather.</p>
               <p>They adore chiefly their Deity <hi>Pillan,</hi> and the Devil, who doth them much hurt. They acknowledge no Reſurrection,<note place="margin">Their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and manner of burying their Dead.</note> accounting long Life in this World the greateſt Good; wherefore when any one dies, the Friends and Relations make a doleful Cry, and ſuffer the dead Body to lie three, nay, four Moneths before they bury them, ſtuffing them full of ſtrong ſmelling Herbs, to keep them from putrifying: Three days before their Interrment the neareſt Allies meet, kill a Sheep, make Merry, and throw the Body into a Hole near the Hut in which the Deceaſed dwelt, putting alſo a piece of the ſlain Sheep, and a Jug full of the Liquor <hi>Chica,</hi> into the Grave.</p>
               <p>Concerning their Idol <hi>Pillan,</hi> to whom with ſtrange Geſtures they Sing divers Songs, they believe that he is a Spirit of the Air, and Governs all things on Earth. Some ſuppoſe him to be Thunder, and therefore they worſhip him in a moſt par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular manner when they hear it Thunder; for then they ſtick an Arrow and Stone Ax into the Ground, and take Arms into their Hands, putting themſelves into a poſture as if they ſhould ſuddenly be ſet upon by a mighty Enemy, and look'd upon it heretofore as a fore-running of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> approach, whoſe Cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties they exceedingly dreaded.</p>
               <p>They call all their Hero's <hi>Pillans,</hi> and aſcribe Divine powers to them.</p>
               <p>They take very much ſtrong Tobacco, the Smoak whereof puffing in the Air with ſtrange Geſtures, they cry, <hi>Receive this, O Pillan.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Their cruel uſage of Priſoners.</note>When they return home Conquerors from any Victory, they put a Stone Ax into the Ground, and ſtanding Arm'd round about the ſame, Drink exceedingly, and ſing a Song in honor of <hi>Pillan.</hi> They uſe their Priſoners very cruelly, for forcing them to Dance and make Merry amongſt them, they on a ſudden cleave their Heads with an Ax, pull their Hearts out of their Bodies, and bite the ſame with their Teeth. After the ſame manner they puniſh their Robbers and Traitors; but thoſe that have good ſtore of <hi>Chica</hi> to Preſent the Governors with, eſcape the Execution: Yet this cannot buy off Sorcerers or Witches, who are without mercy burnt alive, with all they enjoy'd.</p>
               <p>They have no Prieſts, nor any that pretend to any religious Function; onely thoſe that can Sing the <hi>Pawary</hi> well, are in great eſteem amongſt them.</p>
               <p>Their ſecond Deity <hi>Maruapeante</hi> (they ſay) informs them in a Dream when they muſt Marry; but he doth not do them this kindneſs before they have made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Drunk, and ſung Sonnets to his praiſe.</p>
               <p>This Countrey is Govern'd by prime Perſons, call'd <hi>Ulmen,</hi> or peculiar Lords, call'd <hi>Curacen.</hi> The <hi>Ulmens</hi> and <hi>Curacens</hi> Command twenty five, ſometimes fifty, a hundred Families: Their Power conſiſts in calling all the People together, and conſulting with them about State-Affairs, which they dare not do with any parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
<pb n="643" facs="tcp:56274:429"/>Perſon, nor Levy any Tax without extraordinary occaſion. They are bound to march in the Front of their Subjects againſt an Enemy, and are under a Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor-General call'd <hi>Apocurace,</hi> or under a <hi>Nentoque.</hi> Other leſſer Offices are diſpos'd of by the <hi>Curaces,</hi> or <hi>Pulmes;</hi> but their <hi>Netonques</hi> are choſen after this manner, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The manner of chuſing the <hi>Nentoque.</hi>
                  </note> When that honorable Place is vacant, then whoever aims at it, computes with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf whether his Means will extend ſo far as to treat the <hi>Curaces</hi> and <hi>Pulmenes</hi> with a noble Treat; which if he is able to do, then he ſends for them to an appointed place, whither they all go Arm'd, and whileſt they are eating and drinking, he that deſires the Place begins to tell them of his noble Extract, valiant Exploits, Riches, and eminent Relations, and therefore deſires the Place of the deceaſed <hi>Nentoque:</hi> then the <hi>Curace</hi> riſing, the intended <hi>Nentoque</hi> hangs a Chain of <hi>Turkoiſes,</hi> or Cockle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhells about his Neck; whereupon the <hi>Curace</hi> moves the reſt to the Election, without any Articles, the new <hi>Nentoque</hi> onely promiſing to Govern all things for the beſt advantage and benefit of the common State: which done, the <hi>Curace</hi> takes the Chain of <hi>Turkoiſes,</hi> and diſtributes them amongſt the primeſt Perſons of Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and ſo they end the Day in Drinking, Dancing and Singing.</p>
               <p>After the ſame manner they chuſe an <hi>Apocurace,</hi> or prime Governor; which of late the <hi>Uca's,</hi> that they may enjoy the more Priviledge themſelves, have not elected.</p>

                  <note place="margin">A particular Account of <hi>Chili.</hi>
                  </note>As touching the Climate and Production of <hi>Chili,</hi> this Account is given by an Eye-witneſs: <q>The Winter Seaſon (ſaith he) is ſo tempeſtuous, that ſometimes the Trees are not onely blown up by the Roots, but the Earth it ſelf is rent aſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; ſome Valleys being fill'd with Snow, ſwell the Rivers exceedingly when it melts, which overflowing part of the Countrey, makes the ſame very fruitful. It is alſo extream cold here, becauſe ſuch ſharp Winds blow from the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, that they pierce through the Skin and Fleſh of a Man: and indeed theſe Winds would make the whole Countrey deſolate, were not the Mountains over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grown with great Oaken Trees, againſt which the Wind breaks. Moreover, the Valleys produce Coals, which ſerve the Inhabitants for Fewel. The Winter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaves the Trees of Leaves; but not thoſe which grow in the Wilderneſſes. In <hi>March</hi> the Fields are full of innumerable ſorts of ſweet-ſmelling Flowers; out of ſome whereof are boyl'd the <hi>Angel-Water,</hi> ſo call'd for its ſmell and wholſom taſte. The Graſs grows in <hi>November</hi> and <hi>December</hi> as high as our ſtanding Corn. Turnips, Mint, Clover, and Muſtard-ſeed, grow naturally for ſeveral Leagues together. Likewiſe excellent Phyſical Herbs grow here, whoſe power and ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration their Doctors, call'd <hi>Maci,</hi> keep from the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> Theſe <hi>Maci</hi> are in great
<pb n="644" facs="tcp:56274:430"/>eſteem, not onely amongſt the <hi>Chileſes,</hi> but alſo the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> for their great skill in Phyſick. Amongſt theſe Herbs the chiefeſt is call'd <hi>Quincia-mali</hi> which grows but half a hands-breadth above the Ground, and ſpreads into ſeveral Stalks like a Noſegay; and on each Stalk is a Saffron-colour'd Flower. This Herb pull'd up with the Root, and boyl'd, and the Decoction given to any one that is bruis'd within, works moſt wonderfully, for it draws out the putrifi'd. Blood, though ſunk never ſo deep in the Wound. Moreover the Juice of <hi>Culen</hi> is alſo very healing, if us'd for an Ointment, or pour'd on any Wound. This Herb, by the <hi>Spaniards</hi> call'd <hi>Albaciga,</hi> hath ſweet-ſmelling Leaves, and a tall Body. In ſome places alſo grows an Herb, not unlike Graſs, which boyl'd in Water, immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately cures the Feaver and Spleen, and cleanſes the Blood. There are likewiſe Medicines here, which diſſolving the Stone in the Bladder or Kidneys, cauſe it to be urin'd forth. The Plant <hi>Luce,</hi> which grows out of rented Rocks which are often overflow'd by the Sea, makes a ſort of well taſted Bread.</q>

               <p>In the Valley <hi>Chili,</hi> which gives Denomination to the whole Countrey, were formerly the famous Gold-Mines <hi>Quillatas,</hi> from whence <hi>Valdivia,</hi> Anno 1544, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd an invaluable Treaſure. The South Sea makes here a large and convenient Harbor for all manner of Veſſels, built two Leagues below the City <hi>Serena,</hi> at a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle River, which ſo moiſtens the low Countrey, that it produces all manner of Plants.

               <p>From the Entertainment which Sir <hi>Francis Drake</hi> met withal here, may ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently be conjectur'd the Power of <hi>Serena;</hi> for when the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Landed here for Water, they were driven away not without great loſs by three hundred <hi>Caſtilian</hi> Horſe, and two hundred Foot that Sally'd out of the City.

               <p>The City <hi>St. Jago,</hi> lying near the Stream <hi>Topocalma,</hi> receives great benefit by the Haven <hi>Valparayſo,</hi> which makes the fore-mention'd River, becauſe in that Haven all Goods that come from <hi>Lima</hi> are unladen, and the Goods ſhipp'd aboard. The Countrey about the ſame produces plenty of Wines, Apples, Corn, and all ſorts of Cattel, and eſpecially Horſes in ſuch abundance, that thouſands of them run wild.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Valparayſo</hi> Sir <hi>Francis Drake</hi> took a Ship from <hi>Valdivia,</hi> laden with two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand five hundred Bars of fine Gold. But the <hi>Netherland</hi> Admiral, <hi>Joris Spilbergen,</hi> had not ſuch good ſucceſs, who Sailing thither with five Ships, <hi>Anno</hi> 1615. diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ship in the Harbor; where ſending his Boats well Mann'd to fetch off a Veſſel that lay hal'd on the Shore, they found it burning, and thereupon Steer'd their Courſe into a little Inlet full of Rocks, which ſerv'd the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in ſtead of Breaſt-works; for lying behind them, they fir'd continually on the <hi>Hollanders;</hi> yet <hi>Spilbergen</hi> Landing with two hundred Men, met a conſiderable number of <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Soldiers, and Horſes drawn out on the Shore, from whom they ſoon fled.</p>

               <p>Here grows abundance of Wheat and Barley. The Rivers alſo afford plenty of Fiſh, amongſt which there is one call'd <hi>The Lake-Spider,</hi> in whoſe Eyes are to be ſeen little Specks, which would exceed Pearl, if they were but hard enough.</p>

The Inhabitants, a ſtrong People, beckned to the Seamen to come on Shore; ſome lean'd on thick Clubs, others Fenc'd one with another. <hi>Taſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> ſending his Sloop aſhore for Water with two Drakes, return'd without any, not being able to Land, by reaſon of the hollow Sea near the Shore; wherefore Sailing from thence he diſcover'd two low Iſles, which were full of Woods of very tall Trees; from the biggeſt whereof came a little Boat, ſharp before and behind, in which three ſallow Men, ſitting behind one another, Row'd with great ſwift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs towards the <hi>Hemskerk;</hi> whereupon <hi>Taſman</hi> commanded all his Men to go un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Hatches, that the three <hi>Southlanders</hi> might not be afraid to come aboard; he alſo threw a piece of Linnen out of his Cabbin Window, which one of them, leaping into the Sea, took up, and as a ſign of thankfulneſs, laid the ſame on his Head, and being hereby emboldned, they came nearer the Rudder, where they took up a Knife, ty'd to a piece of Wood, out of the Water, and return'd the Seamen a Fiſhhook of Mother-of-Pearl, ty'd to a Cotton Line. Approaching the Shore, they ſaw abundance of People running along, with two little Flags on Sticks. Some of the Natives came in their Boats cloſe up with <hi>Taſman</hi>'s Ship; and one more bold than the reſt entring the ſame, was found to be a tall Man with a broad black Beard, and green Leaves about his Neck, who ſat down on the Deck with his Legs under him, and bow'd down his Head oftentimes very low: <hi>Taſman</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning his Civility, took him by the Hand to Treat him in his Cabbin, but a
<pb n="656" facs="tcp:56274:435"/>Dog which was in the Ship Barking, he grew fearful, and went into his Boat again. Several other <hi>Southlanders</hi> ſwam aboard, and others brought <hi>Piſang</hi> and <hi>Clappes</hi> in their Boats. Againſt the Evening a great Veſſel, ſurrounded with leſſer Boats, came Rowing towards the <hi>Hemskerk,</hi> the Men making a great noiſe; the Seamen fearing ſome Deſign, ran all to their Arms, but were convinc'd of their Friendſhip by the Gifts they Preſented them with from the Governor of the Iſland. The next day a ſtrange Boat came near the <hi>Sea-Cock, viz.</hi> two Sloops, which being ty'd together, and cover'd with Boards, carry'd ſeveral Men, Commanded by a Captain, by them call'd <hi>Orangkay:</hi> On the midſt of the Boards which co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd the two Boats, ſtood a Hut made of Ruſhes, and cover'd over with <hi>Piſang</hi> Leaves; the Sails being made of Mats, caus'd it to Sail very ſwiftly. Round about this Sloop Row'd leſſer Boats, out of which loud Acclamations were heard, every one crying out, <hi>Hael, Hael:</hi> during which noiſe, thoſe <hi>Southlanders</hi> which were already come aboard, ſat ſtill on the Decks, which made <hi>Taſman</hi> think that their King himſelf was coming to give him a Viſit, which accordingly fell out, for he came and Preſented him with ſeveral Hogs, Poultrey, <hi>Clappes</hi> and <hi>Piſang,</hi> all cover'd with white Cloths.</p>

               <p>Theſe <hi>Southlanders</hi> barter'd their Clothes and Necklaces, which conſiſted of Mother-of-Pearl and white Cockles, and Fiſhhooks made alſo of Mother-of-Pearl, againſt Nails, Knives, and the like Trifles.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Taſman</hi> caus'd a Shirt, Breeches, Doublet, and Hat, to be put on an old <hi>Orang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kay;</hi> who being thus Cloth'd, ſtood a conſiderable time admiring of himſelf, and was alſo much wonder'd at by his Subjects; but going into the Countrey, he came back without his Clothes.</p>
               <p>Another <hi>Orangkay</hi> being Preſented with a Rummer of Wine, pour'd out the Wine, and ſetting the Rummer on his Head, went away with great joy.</p>
               <p>Some of the Governors view'd the Ships, not onely above, but alſo below the Decks, and being brought to the Guns, they deſir'd to know the uſe of them; whereupon one being Diſcharg'd, it ſo affrighted them, that had they not been held, they had all leap'd overboard.</p>
               <p>Proviſions were daily brought by the <hi>Southlanders</hi> to the <hi>Hollanders</hi> in great Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, ſurrounded by many leſſer; ſtill as they put their Oars into the Water, they made a hideous noiſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Taſman</hi> bringing ſome empty Veſſels upon the Deck, thereby to make them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand that he wanted freſh Water, the <hi>Orangkays</hi> pointed to the Shore; whither they went with two Boats, which return'd without Water, the Inhabitants them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves being forc'd to dig Pits to get the ſame.</p>
               <p>Mean while other <hi>Southlanders</hi> coming aboard, the Pilot and Boatſwain's Boy blow'd on their Trumpets, another play'd on a Flute, and a fourth on a Violin whileſt ſome of the the Seamen Dancing, ſo amaz'd the Natives, that they ſtood like ſenſeleſs Creature, gaping with open Mouth upon them.</p>

The Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens Apparel differ'd little from the Mens, excepting that their Aprons reach'd farther down, <hi>viz.</hi> to their Knees. They barter'd their Clothes againſt Nails. Some of the <hi>Orangkays,</hi> being Entertain'd in the Cabbin, wonder'd to ſee a Bullet that was Diſcharg'd from the Quarter-deck, fall into the Water at ſo great a diſtance. They wore about their Necks Mother-of-Pearl, white Cockles, ſweet-ſmelling Flowers, green Leaves, or the Nails which they had gotten of the <hi>Hollanders:</hi> Some of the aged Women wanted both their little Fingers, and the young ones the upper Joynts of them, which the old Men alſo wanted: <hi>Haelbos</hi> pointing at the Stump, ask'd the reaſon of it, but one of them laying his Hand under his Chin, made ſtrange Signs, out of which he could apprehend nothing.</p>
               <p>On the twenty third of <hi>January,</hi> a ſecond time <hi>Taſman</hi> went aſhore for Water, carrying Spades and Pick-axes with him, to dig Pits with. Two of the <hi>Hollanders</hi> Boats going cloſe together, in each of which were three <hi>Southlanders, Taſman</hi> call'd to his Rowers to pull ſtoutly; which the <hi>Southlanders</hi> in <hi>Taſman</hi>'s Boat obſerving to tend to their Rowing the ſwifter, laugh'd and hooted at their Countrey-men that were in the <hi>Sea-Cocks</hi> Boat, when they chanc'd to get beyond them. <hi>Taſman</hi> in his going aſhore diſcover'd ſeveral Iſles at a diſtance, was kindly Entertain'd, and towards the Evening carry'd by four Men through the Water, on a Mat made faſt betwixt two Poles, to his Sloop, whither they alſo brought nine Hogs, and freſh Water digg'd out of Pits.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Taſman</hi> being got about the Point of the Iſland, ſaw the <hi>Hemskerk</hi> under Sail; wherefore Rowing aboard the <hi>Sea-Cock,</hi> he was inform'd that ſhe had ſlipt her An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor; whereupon following her, he got ſight of another green Iſland the next day, along the Shore whereof ran ſeveral People with Sticks, on which hung white Cloths: ſome of them came aboard, and brought with them what Proviſions the Iſland afforded. The Inhabitants barter'd <hi>Clappes, Piſang,</hi> Fowls, Hogs, Mother-of-Pearl Fiſh-hooks, Stone Axes, little Stools, great Clubs, with a black Point as long as a Man's Arm, and hooked, againſt Trifles. The <hi>Hollanders</hi> were alſo ſtor'd here with freſh Water. The People both in Language, Habit, rud Cuſtoms, were very like thoſe of the firſt Iſland, but were not altogether ſo courteous. One of the <hi>Southlanders</hi> ſtealing a Half-pike out of the Boat was forc'd by his Companions to reſtore the ſame.</p>
               <p>The fore-mention'd <hi>Haelbos</hi> relates, That going aſhore with ſome Soldiers, he ſaw their Houſes, which he found to be built after a ſtrange manner, <hi>viz.</hi> ſome of them were round like Towers, Wider at top than at bottom, and without any Holes for Air, but all built cloſe of Canes, which were ſtuck in the Ground; other
<pb n="658" facs="tcp:56274:436"/>Huts were cover'd with a long Roof of <hi>Piſang</hi> or <hi>Clappes</hi> Leaves, reſting on Poſts; under which kind of Building <hi>Haelbos</hi> ſhelter'd himſelf againſt a mighty Shower of Rain, found divers young Men and Women ſitting on Mats, and an old Woman, blind through Age, lying by them on the Ground, and Fanning her ſelf with <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſang</hi> Leaves: The Men going away, ſignifi'd thereby a kind of Invitation to the <hi>Hollanders</hi> to go to the Women, who not receiving the Entertainment they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, roſe altogether on a ſudden, and Singing, Danc'd about the <hi>Hollanders.</hi> The Men had on their Shoulders and Breaſts, Scars of half an Inch deep, and an Inch long; upon ſome of which, being freſh and bleeding, the Flyes ſat. They eat after a ſtrange manner, for ſtripping off the outmoſt Rinds of the <hi>Clappes</hi> with their Teeth, and breaking the hard Shell againſt their Elbows, they pull out the Kernel, and eat the ſame. Whatever Fleſh-meat they eat, they never throughly boyl or roaſt it, but make it onely juſt warm. They ſleep on the Ground upon Mats, and lay their Heads on a little woodden Cricket with four Feet. They take great pride in their Hair, and thoſe that have not long Hair of their own, uſe Perukes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Taſman</hi> ſteering his Courſe towards the high Coaſt that lay before this Iſland, was follow'd by ſeveral ſmall Veſſels from the adjacent Shore, of which ſome car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd a Bough of <hi>Clappes</hi> or <hi>Piſang,</hi> with white Veins at the ends; but ſeeing the Ships Sail from them, they threw the ſame overboard. <hi>Taſman</hi> ſtanding Weſterly, diſcover'd three Iſles, near the laſt whereof the Sea broke exceedingly, which the <hi>Hollanders</hi> not without great danger had approached in the Night: after which they diſcover'd to Leeward of them, a high Coaſt, which extended it ſelf a great way, but the Sea went ſo rough, that they durſt not venture near the Land; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, the Sea went very high on a Bank, firſt ten, then five, three and a half, and again ten, fourteen, and ſeven Fathom deep; and oftentimes a Man might ſee the Ground, inſomuch that they kept out the Boats belonging to the <hi>Hemskerk,</hi> which was in moſt danger, to carry them aboard of the <hi>Sea-Cock,</hi> if the firſt ſhould chance to ſplit. Laſtly, getting over the Bank, they ſaw very high Land to Windward, and many hilly Iſles to Leeward; the Sea alſo was full of blind Rocks and Shelves, ſo that they were in danger every hour, and the rather, becauſe the Wind blew hard every day; yet at laſt loſing ſight of Land, they ſteer'd their Courſe Weſterly in five Degrees Southward of the <hi>Line,</hi> towards <hi>New Guinee.</hi> On the two and twentieth of <hi>March</hi> they diſcover'd low Land full of Woods of tall Trees, ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded with a company of Iſles, againſt ſome of which the Sea brake with great violence, inſomuch that they were again in great danger, eſpecially when they were got amongſt eighteen Iſles, between which the Water being ſhallow, and the Current running very ſtrongly, drove the Ships towards the Shore: Whileſt they were Tacking to and again to get beyond the Shelves, a little Veſſel, carrying a great Weather-cock on her Star-board, came from the Shore, Row'd by ſeven Men, who ſat on Boards which lay over the ſame; they were of a brown Complexion, onely girt about with a hairy Girdle, made faſt on the top of their Heads; under their Feet they alſo wore ſomething in ſtead of Shoes, about their Necks hung Flowers, and their Bodies were Painted black: Among the ſeven, one who was very fat, and whoſe Head was adorn'd with two Feathers, ſtood up and proffer'd the Seamen two <hi>Clappes,</hi> in return whereof <hi>Taſman</hi> gave them a Box of Nails and a piece of Sail-cloth, which ſinking under Water, an aged Man div'd for the ſame, and bringing it up, gave it to his ſix Companions, who made no ſhew of thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs. Their Arms conſiſted in Bowes and Arrows. Their <hi>Clappes</hi> they call'd <hi>Anieuw,</hi> as the other Iſlanders had done.</p>
               <pb n="659" facs="tcp:56274:436"/>
               <p>Sailing from hence, they diſcover'd two low Iſlands full of Trees; and three Leagues from them, on their Star-board, a high Coaſt, and on the other ſide a great Iſland, whither they drove with a ſmall Gale; approaching the ſame, two very ſmall Boats came towards the <hi>Hemskerk;</hi> the biggeſt of the two carry'd ſix Men, and the leaſt three, all of them very deform'd; they went ſtark naked, onely their Yards were ty'd up with a String on their Bellies, and about their Arms hung Chains of Mother-of-Pearl; they were Coal-black, onely red about the Mouth, which redneſs was occaſion'd by the chewing of <hi>Piſang;</hi> in their Hair ſtuck wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Combs, and on their Foreheads green Leaves; but in each Boat was one who had a bruiſed Reed made faſt in his Neck like a Plume; the biggeſt Veſſel was Painted with ſtrange Shapes of Men and Beaſts; they us'd red Bowes and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows, and having call'd to the Seamen, they Row'd back again to the Shore; which <hi>Taſman</hi> left a Stern of him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ran between the Main Coaſt (by all ſuppos'd to be <hi>New Guinee</hi>) and ſeveral great Iſlands, that lay ſcatter'd along before the Main Coaſt; from whence came four ſmall Boats, adorn'd with Imagery like Serpents, but kept without Gun-ſhot from the Ships; at laſt one leaping overboard, ſwam to the ſmalleſt Boat, out of which one ſwam back in his ſtead to the other, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards came to the <hi>Hemskerks</hi> ſide; he was a black Man, wore Leaves before his Privities, and Armlets about his Elbows; through the Griſtle of his Noſe ſtuck a white Bone Bodkin, ſharp at the ends, and of a Fingers length, and about his Neck a String full of Cockle-ſhells.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Taſman</hi> Sailing on along the Main Coaſt, met with eighteen Boats more, the Rowers whereof laid their Oars upon their Heads, and not without ſtrange Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures call'd aloud, and invited the <hi>Hollanders</hi> to come aſhore: On the Sterns and Heads of theſe Boats were likewiſe divers Shapes Painted, upon a white Ground; in ſome were two, and in others three, four, and five Men; eight of them going into the <hi>Hollanders</hi> Boats, were made Drunk with <hi>Arrack.</hi> Theſe <hi>Southlanders</hi> went ſtark naked, ſome onely covering their ſecret Parts with Leaves; their Skins were black, onely on their Foreheads they drew a red Stroke, which reach'd to their Ears; their brown curl'd Hair was by ſome colour'd grey, by ſome red, ſome let it hang looſe over their Sholdiers, others ty'd the ſame in a Tuft on their Crown, cover'd with a Cap of <hi>Piſang</hi> Leaves, others wore their Hair ſcarce two Fingers long, and through the Griſtle of their Noſe, a piece of Cane or Quill, and a broad Beard without Muſtacho's; they had nothing to barter but large Snail-ſhells, on which they made a ſtrange noiſe; and whatſoe're they receiv'd, they firſt ſmell'd on it like Dogs: they fancy'd not Nails, as all the other <hi>Southlanders</hi> had done. Their manner of Fiſhing was thus: They ty'd ſeveral half <hi>Clappes</hi>-ſhells, made faſt like a Chain, to a long Reed, ſhook the ſame to and again on the Water, to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Fiſh together. In the Boats lay Planks of an oval faſhion, which by Ropes ty'd in the middle they held before them in ſtead of Shields. When theſe <hi>South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers</hi> went from the Ships, one of them threatned to beat the Seamen, ſhaking his great Club at them; whereupon they all Row'd with great ſpeed to the Shore, whileſt one in every Boat knockt with a Staff againſt the ſides, juſt as if they had beat an Alarm. Amongſt them one had barter'd for an old Doublet, with which he ſhew'd many antick Tricks, putting it on the wrong way, ſometimes on his Head, then his Feet into the two Arm-holes, and anon the Button-holes behind on his Back.</p>
               <p>The Ships Sailing from hence, ran along a broken Coaſt, and on the twelfth of <hi>April</hi> were ſo terribly ſhaken by an Earthquake, which laſted an hour and a half, that they ſeem'd ſhivering to pieces in the Water, as if they had ran againſt a
<pb n="660" facs="tcp:56274:437"/>Rock, notwithſtanding they could not fathom Ground with their longeſt Line. Somewhat farther they diſcover'd a burning Mountain on an Iſland, between which and the Main (on which ſtood alſo a very high Mountain) they ſteering their Courſe, came into a white Water, mov'd by a ſtrong River from the Continent; and coming to an Anchor before the Iſland <hi>Jamna,</hi> they ſaw the Iſles <hi>Moa</hi> and <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moa</hi> before them. The <hi>Jamneans</hi> calling <hi>New Guinee</hi> by the Name of <hi>Belah,</hi> inform'd the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> that they Warr'd continually with the Inhabitants thereof. Theſe People being alſo Coal-black, ſome of them had looſe curl'd Hair, hanging down over their Shoulders in long Braids, and others had onely two thick Locks, which cover'd their Ears; all of them wore four Feathers on their Heads: the Men pull'd out their Beards, and hung a great Bone Ring through their Ears, at which alſo hung a Shell like a Spur; moſt of them had red Roſes ty'd about their Heads, and a Necklace of Hogs Teeth about their Necks; under their Navels they wore Gir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles, a handful and a half broad, and about their Waſtes Strings full of Shells, or Sea-Cockles, to which a ſmall Lappet was ty'd, and hung down before their Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vities; but becauſe it was but two Fingers broad, and moy'd to an again by the Wind, their Nakedneſs appear'd to thoſe that took notice thereof; through the Griſtle of their Noſes they wore a Hogs Tooth, or the Splinter of a Cane. Upon the Stern of their ſmall Boats was the Shape of a little Lyon. One of theſe Iſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders imitated the <hi>Hollanders</hi> when they ſpoke, endeavoring to repeat their words after them, and therefore was call'd <hi>Parrot.</hi>

Theſe People were of a ſallow Complexion; they broke their Arrows with great Ceremony; for firſt they pointed with them towards the Skie, then put them into the Water, and breaking each Arrow in two pieces on their Heads, they threw one over the Larboard, and the other over the Starboard; he that broke the Arrow, made a long Speech to the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> who took the ſame for an Oath of their Fidelity toward them.

                  </note>
                  <hi>Iſeland,</hi> ſo call'd from the continual Ice which is upon it, is a craggy mountain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Countrey; and not onely the Hills, but a great part of the Low-land cover'd with perpetual Snow: It is of a Form ſomewhat oblong, lying between the fifty fourth and fifty ninth Degree of Northern Latitude, having <hi>Norway</hi> on the Eaſt, the <hi>Orcades</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> on the South, <hi>Grenland</hi> on the Weſt, and the <hi>Hyperborean,</hi> or frozen Sea on the North. It is by <hi>Olaus Magnus</hi> ſuppos'd to be twice as big as <hi>Sicily,</hi> that is to ſay, about a hundred Leagues in length. It is the moſt known, and moſt througly diſcover'd of all the Countreys of the <hi>Artick Region,</hi> and is ſaid to have been firſt found out and peopled in the Year of our Lord 900. by certain of the Nobility of <hi>Eaſt-Friſia</hi> in the Countrey of <hi>Breme,</hi> in the time of <hi>Alebrand,</hi> Biſhop of that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey; but whether or no utterly unpeopled till that time, is a Queſtion not eaſie to be determin'd, though in all probability ſo obvious a Place to be found out, could not lie ſo long totally uninhabited. Not long after ſeveral Colonies of <hi>Norwegians</hi> Setled themſelves, ſome in <hi>Hitland,</hi> ſome in <hi>Ferow,</hi> others (following the Example of theſe <hi>Bremers</hi>) in <hi>Iſeland.</hi> The Countrey is full of Rocks and Stones, and (as is credibly reported) not a cultivated Field or Garden in the whole Iſland, and by conſequence no ſort of Corn, yet the People living without either Bread or Salt, are very ſtrong, and of a good Complexion: Neither is there a Tree to be ſeen, except the Birch, which likewiſe grows but in one place, and exceeds not the heighth of a Man, by reaſon of the violence of the Winds; yet there is ſaid to be great plenty of Butter, the Graſs being ſo fat, that the Oxen are not ſuffer'd to ſtay long at a time in the Paſtures for fear of burſting. Till of late there was neither Town, nor any thing that could be call'd a Village, in the whole Iſland, but ſtragling Cottages here and there, not above three or four together in a place, moſt by the Sea ſide for the convenience of Fiſhing; they were built pretty deep in the Ground, but artificially fram'd of Whales Bones, with Seats, Benches, and other Utenſils of the ſame; now ſometimes they uſe Fir to the ſame purpoſe, which is caſt upon the Coaſt by the force of the Sea from <hi>Tartary</hi> or elſewhere. For want of Veſſels, they lay their Butter in Heaps in the Corners of their Houſes like Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar. In the Winter, wanting Fodder, they feed their Cattel with Fiſh. Beſides theſe Cattel, which are Kine without Horns, Horſes onely fit for carrying of Burthens, and very large Sheep, there are ſtore of white Foxes, and huge Bears of the ſame colour, and a ſort of rough Dogs, very well known, and frequent amongſt us by the Name of <hi>Shocks,</hi> which the Iſlanders eſteem not a little, and will part with their Children at a far eaſier rate: They keep neither Hogs nor Poultrey, for want of Grain to feed them.</p>
